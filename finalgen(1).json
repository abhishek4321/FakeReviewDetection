[{"Review ": "I had just binged all weekend on booze, and was about to indulge in a Sunday Funday. I needed some sort of food, and wanted it to be healthy. This was the closest thing to Penn Station I could find... so the location is key.I couldn&#39;t decide what to get, so the friendly baristas were able to help me decide and were knowledgeable about the food. I got the kale/avocado egg white omelette...I didn&#39;t even know avocado could be in an omelette, but at this point I don&#39;t know if I can ever have an omelette the same again. The serving was massive, fresh, fluffy, and was by far the best omelette I ever got. I also got a fresh juice (Saw them make it in front of me) and got all my nutrients before I went for a day of shots (sorry I&#39;m not sorry).The decor is relaxed, bright, rustic, earthy... but still feels like a chic NYC place. The service is exceptional. My only negative is that the price is high... but then again its NYC, so its likely on par with evertyhing else.", "Ratings": 5.0, "Reviewcount": "599", "coolvote": "1", "Usefulvote": "", "Friendcount": "238", "funnyvote": "1", "No_of_checkin": "", "No_of_Photos": "118", "Review_length": 186}, {"Review ": "This place WAS my go-to health conscious breakfast spot for the last 2 months.They offer a good variety of fresh vegetable juices.

The workers are kind and very genuine2. There is free wifi3. There are a lot of seats and tables here, and with the wifi, you can potentially do some work here if you wanted to.On the flip side,1. The smoothies here are terrible. I ordered the smoothie with protein peanut butter chocolate and a banana (I can&#39;t remember what it was called). It literally tasted like protein and it was VERY starchy. No sweetness and felt as though it wasn&#39;t complete. For $10, I expected a lot more.2. My friend ordered a coffee smoothie and had a similar problem with mine. I tried his, and also thought it tasted terrible.3. I ordered the ginger cayenne lemon shots as well. I was so excited because a lot of restaurant don&#39;t add the cayenne. What seemed like a lot of potential, ended up being a shot that might have been better with only ginger. The cayenne and lemon proportional amounts were definitely incorrect.4. It took a little over 20 minutes to get my order, which for a pretty empty juice place, seemed kind of long.Overall, not a fan of the smoothies, the ginger shot, or the price.

Honestly I think I wish there was less lox on it, because I tasted it alone and it was the culprit of the salt bomb...had there been a better balance I think I would have enjoyed it more.- Toast your bagel, but be mindful that the outside toppings (i.e. garlic or onions) will likely get burnt in the process, which can take away from the bagel experience.Overall though, I&#39;m glad that I was able to stop by and try this place!

So when you are a lover of New York and New Haven style pizzas, and you order what looks like it should be a pizza, then getting served &#34;pizza&#34; on a flatbread is a little disappointing. Had this been explained before I placed the order, I probably would have gotten a different flavor. The woman tells us what it is well after the order is placed and she heard my friend saying that she didn&#39;t want to eat anything from there since she didn&#39;t know what any of it was.The flatbread was made to order, and it had a nice fresh flavor. It&#39;s something that I would get again if I were on a diet and didn&#39;t want the guilt of eating regular pizza.The Americano was like a flat bread sandwich. It had grilled chicken, mozzarella, and roasted peppers. All I could taste was the cheese. The peppers provided some texture and after eating the first half I said &#34;i thought there was supposed to be chicken in here?&#34; So I deconstructed a piece of the second half. There was a small amount of chicken, but it looked shredded, just like tuna from a can and i definitely couldn&#39;t taste it due to the strong flavor and large amount of the cheese in this sandwich.This place was a good light snack to hold me over until dinner. I wasn&#39;t overly full and it was a pleasant change from all of the heavy quick prepared foods in NY and It&#39;s definitely provides a &#34;lighter than pizza&#34; pizza option", "Ratings": 3.0, "Reviewcount": "73", "coolvote": "", "Usefulvote": "", "Friendcount": "80", "funnyvote": "", "No_of_checkin": "1", "No_of_Photos": "136", "Review_length": 289}, {"Review ": "Delicious.

I don&#39;t usually buy the same soup two visits in a row, but this was so good the first time that I got it, I had to get it again when I visited next. It is so smooth, seasoned well, with a reasonable amount of ham here and there (not too much, not too little).Clam Chowder (New England, I think) - I love this soup! I think it is the perfect consistency, not too thick, not too heavy.Boston Clam Chowder - My husband picked this up for me at 4pm after work. Maybe because the soup was from the bottom of the pot, it was a bit thicker than the other chowders, or maybe it is supposed to be that way.Atlantic Seafood Chowder - I think this is my favorite chowder thus far, I like how there are a few pieces of salmon here and there. Again, I like this consistency, not too heavy, not too thick. Well seasoned.Lobster, Shrimp &amp; Salmon Bisque - This soup would be perfect for me if there was less salt. After every two spoonfuls, I had to chase it down with some water, no joke. My husband says that North Americans like their soups more salty. There were a few small pieces of salmon. Again, great taste, excellent consistency, not too heavy, not too thick, just a bit salty for me.Bacon &amp; Scallop Chowder - I enjoyed this when I had it, but it wasn&#39;t that memorable now that I am writing this review retroactively.Minestrone - Disclaimer: I prefer my soups less hearty. This soup was a bit too hearty for me. It had a lot of other stuff - carrots, potatoes, little tubular pasta, cabbage, cauliflower, beans. It certainly felt healthy (healthier than the chowders), but I finished all the soup part, but I had to throw it out with some remaining potatoes, pasta and such.Wild Mushroom Bisque - Compared to the other soups, this is like their &#34;low sodium&#34; soup. It was good, but I felt like it was missing something, like maybe salt and pepper, I totally debated whether to add it on my own.

I&#39;ve also come to the realization that I was much too harsh in my initial review.The first thing about this place is that you need to know what to order. The suprema and pepperoni slices are actually not that good, and I wouldn&#39;t recommend them. However, they do have some slices which are pretty decent. The vegetarian square, the upside down pepperoni (new) and the fresh mushroom are all really solid choices.The other good things about this place is that there is seating, and that it&#39;s air conditioned. During summers, this is a godsend, but more practically, most other pizzeria joints either don&#39;t feature seating, or if they do, it&#39;s not very good. The tables at suprema are bussed to spotlessness, and it&#39;s very comfortable. There&#39;s also ample seating as well.The one problem with this place is that it&#39;s a little expensive. The fresh mushroom, while pretty good, is an expensive slice for sure at $4.50. It doesn&#39;t surprise me that considering rent right next to Penn station (which has heavy foot traffic), they need to charge relatively high prices for pizza here- so with that considered, it&#39;s probably priced fairly.

The decor is definitely traditional, and there are old black and white photos of family members along the walls.The turnover is quick here, and they offer a variety of pizzas in both thin crust and Sicilian style. You can order by the slice, which we did, or buy a whole pie to dine in or have it to go. We&#39;ve been here twice and my favorite pizza has got to be their Margherita thin crust pizza. Crispy crust, but soft in the middle. They put enough mozzarella cheese so that it&#39;s gooey and pulls away from the pizza in long strands - just the way it should be! I love the fresh tomatoes and fragrant basil on this pizza as well. My family tried their Sicilian pizza, but they admitted they preferred the thin crust more.

We put all our trust in Siri and asked where the best pizza place in New York City was, and that was when NY Pizza Suprema popped up.It was a 16 minute walk down 8th street, which we were already on.

It was the opposite direction! It is now a 32 minute walk. Meanwhile the time now is 11:30 and they close at 12am. So we started running down 8th street. I mean we were booking it.... for pizza. The run took us about 15-20 minutes before finally arriving.When we finally got there, I just felt sooo happy inside.

This is part of the reason why I waited to write this review for a while, but I believe it is time to do so.I&#39;ve discovered Jonny&#39;s Panini &amp; Coffee Bar a few years ago because of my coffee (but mostly good coffee) addicted coworker. At the time it was still known as Scarpella and tucked away in a tiny spot across the street from B&amp;H, with my company&#39;s office less than a block away.That space was way too small to be able to hold both a coffee and a panini place so I am very glad that Jonny managed to move to a bigger location.There are two main components to this place:1) The coffee. I don&#39;t really drink coffee in general, and if I do it is mostly decaf, yet I can still tell you that the coffee here is both delicious and of high quality. I usually get a decaf mocha which is amazing. Fair warning though: it is highly addictive! Even the biggest coffee snobs will consider the coffee here to be at least decent, I think it is great2) The paninis: When I used to eat meat I would get the grilled chicken panini (Grilled chicken breast, tomato and lettuce with Pesto), it was quite a popular choice and Jonny would sometimes run out of it if I came in after the lunch time rush. More recently I would get the Caprese Panini (Buffalo mozzarella and tomato with Basil Pesto). Both paninis are fantastic, the flavors are relatively simple but they mesh in just the right way. The quality of the paninis is consistent and never left me disappointed.One other warning is that these paninis take time to make, so if you are in a rush to get lunch, this might not be the right place (unless you pre-order).Since I have come here a good amount (mostly with my coworker but sometimes without), I got to talk to Jonny quite a bit and got to know him to a certain extent and what he&#39;s about.Jonny is a very cheerful person but he&#39;s a chef who is very passionate about what he does, cares about the quality of each ingredient and is a crazy perfectionist. He crafted the menu with a lot of care so he does not allow substitutes, which understandably can annoy some people but is fine with me.I should mention that I brought my boyfriend here and he loved his panini as well, so I know that I&#39;m not truly biased, this place deserves all the praise it gets.", "Ratings": 5.0, "Reviewcount": "117", "coolvote": "2", "Usefulvote": "2", "Friendcount": "35", "funnyvote": "", "No_of_checkin": 0, "No_of_Photos": "87", "Review_length": 451}, {"Review ": "For a tiny little joint, this place won&#39;t disappoint !!Great Paninis made with Love.The owner positive and friendly attitude alone is a real pleasure !", "Ratings": 5.0, "Reviewcount": "32", "coolvote": "", "Usefulvote": "2", "Friendcount": "1", "funnyvote": "1", "No_of_checkin": "1", "No_of_Photos": "62", "Review_length": 25}, {"Review ": "This amazing little panini shop is a must!

The sandwiches are good, I will give them that, but the service is enough to deter one from ever returning.A few months back I came here with co-workers where we watched Johnny shamelessly yell at one of his staff members who was helping take orders instead of packing potato chips into to-go bags (it was a busy day). We were shocked to see this self-proclaimed jolly sandwich man treat his staff so poorly, nonetheless in front of a crowd.Another time I placed an online pick-up order. When I went into the shop to pay, I was getting my punch card stamped by a staff member, where he grabbed it out of his hands and screamed &#34;DIS... DIS YOU CANNOT USE FOR PICK UP ORDERS! NEVER AGAIN!&#34; His delivery was absolutely awful but I just laughed it off.Today was the icing on the cake for me. Upon stumbling into here for lunch, I was denied - yes, DENIED service from the King JP himself. When I asked to substitute my sauce (as I usually do), he waved his finger in my face saying &#34;No, no, no, as the board says we do NOT do substitutions.&#34; I calmly stated back, &#34;Are you sure? I have done this before&#34;. &#34;NO, NO.. NOT AT JONNY PANINI AND CERTAINLY NOT FROM ME, JONNY!&#34; he yelled back. We went back and forth a few times when I eventually gave up &amp; walked out - he didn&#39;t even try to stop me from leaving or offering another item on the menu I would have maybe liked.Mind you, the place was empty and I was the only customer in there. I am not sure why he could not make this simple swap for me, it&#39;s not like I was asking for his first born. Are the sandwiches pre-made that he could not make this simple request? Makes me question the freshness of his items. He could not give me a logical explanation as to why.It&#39;s clear that this man does not know how to treat his staff, and sadly his customers too. He lost my business today along with everyone in my office who has had similar experiences with his pompous &amp; condescending ways. You will also notice he does not have consistent people working there - I wonder why...There are plenty of great sandwich shops in the area (sergimmo salumeria, la panineria) who know how to treat their customers right. This is a disgruntled man who only cares about the dollars in his pocket and his wall mural. If you have to order from them, do yourself a favor and order online so you don&#39;t have to have any human interaction with this man. What. a. shame.**UPDATE: after this review posted, Jonny took the time to message me on Yelp. Instead of trying to rectify the situation, he only continued to insult me, told me to go eat at Subway, and that he yells because it&#39;s in his blood... &#34;he&#39;s Italian&#34; (his words, not mine). He also told me I lied about ordering sandwiches in the past that had substitutions and that I should learn to be honest. (?!) If this doesn&#39;t capture the type of person this man is, I don&#39;t know what else will. His passive comment below also proves how this man cannot address a problem that is clearly evident in his business practices.He also threatened two other woman here on Yelp to remove their negative reviews - which I know because they private messaged me thanking me that I wrote such a honest review and they unfortunately had similar experiences. They took them down due to these threats, so don&#39;t be fooled by the 5 star reviews.", "Ratings": 1.0, "Reviewcount": "17", "coolvote": "2", "Usefulvote": "24", "Friendcount": "5", "funnyvote": "9", "No_of_checkin": 0, "No_of_Photos": 0, "Review_length": 665}, {"Review ": "The paninis here are exactly what they&#39;re like in Italy.

Korean food is my favorite, and the idea of a Korean Chipotle-style restaurant was exciting! I went there finally, and my excitement quickly faded.I went to Purple Rice after work before going to an event and the first thing I noticed was it was quite spacious, which was nice. When I was deciding what to get, the staff kind of just stood there and was not helpful at all. I feel like they didn&#39;t even know anything about Korean food. This was confirmed when I asked for tteok-bokki and they didn&#39;t know what I was asking for, even though it is written on their menu.I ended up ordering kimchi fried rice with crispy chicken, bulgolgi, and tteok-bokki at a cost of $13.00. What was immediately noticeable was that everything is lacking sauce. The chicken was particularly hard to eat as it was dry, and with little sauce it was hard going down. The bulgolgi had decent flavor but was also dry. The kimchi fried rice was also dry, and the flavor too mild. The only thing that wasn&#39;t dry was the tteok-bokki because it is in a sea of sauce. If all you&#39;re getting right is putting your tteok-bokki in sauce, then you&#39;re doing it wrong.This meal was not worth $13.00. The portions for each item are small, the taste is mediocre at best, and the sauces are all lacking. Purple Rice is taking advantage of the fact that Koreatown is not that close because if this were near any restaurant there, nobody would ever eat here.

I&#39;ve been wanting to come to this place since it opened up and finally had a chance to last night. Interior is really clean and actually very large - there&#39;s a ton of seating and also easy to takeout.The menu is simple - you can choose a box (~$13) or a bowl (~$10). Boxes are a base plus three entrees and bowls are base plus two entrees. The base consists of white rice, purple rice, kimchi fried rice, and japchae (sweet potato noodles). Entrees are varied - there&#39;s pork, chicken, tofu, rice cakes, etc.I ordered japchae base bowl with spicy pork and dukbokki (spicy rice cake) and got a small side of kimchi jiggae soup (~$5). Everything was really good. The spicy pork was fresh and seasoned perfectly. The dukbokki was a little sweet, but delicious - spicy, soft. The japchae was wonderful, the noodles were cooked well and the vegetables inside were great.The best part of it all - the kimchi jiggae soup. Wow! K town kimchi jiggae can be up to $15 (the tax and tip when you sit down), but as Purple Rice is a grab and go, for $5 small or $10 large - it&#39;s perfect price and better quality. The manager last night said that it takes about 2 weeks to make their kimchi in-house. The soup is authentic and it&#39;s worth a try. It&#39;s a little salty, so make sure you get a side of rice for it.I&#39;m definitely coming back.

If there were half stars, I would probably give this a 4.5, since there are some Korean spots where I like the food better, but rounding up instead of down because there isn&#39;t a lot of affordable and customizable Korean fast casual in the city. I like that this fills that niche.For our first visit, the bowl seemed like the best option. For $9.95 pre-tax, you get a base plus 2 toppings. The base could be white rice, purple rice, kimchi fried rice, or japchae. Pretty much everything but the white rice appealed to me, and I considered purple rice considering that I like it and it&#39;s the name of the place, but in the end my love for kimchi fried rice won out. And it was good kimchi fried rice.For the entrees on top, I got the spicy chicken, which seemed like chicken stewed in a red gochujang-based sauce, and the crispy tofu, which was blocks of fried tofu in a tasty ginger scallion sauce. My husband got the bulgogi and the ddukboki (rice cakes), both of which were also good. If I had to pick favorites, it would probably be the spicy chicken and the bulgogi, but I did like how the tofu balanced out the heavier seasoned chicken in the bowl I got. Pretty happy with the choices.I would definitely go back to Purple Rice to try more of the entrees and options.

Cinnamon Snail delivered just what my inner fat kid needed. This place is the best.

I believe I had another location in mind and didn&#39;t realize they were here, too.The menu was a bit overwhelming at first because I literally wanted to eat it all- mac n&#39; cheese, cashew cheese tater tots, thanksgiving sandwich- and all vegan. Score! I reined myself in a bit (just a bit) and went with the Beastmode burger. As the name suggests, this one has it all. It&#39;s an ancho chili seitan burger grilled in maple hickory bbq sauce with jalapeno mac n cheese, arugula, smoked chili coconut bacon &amp; chipotle mayo on a grilled pretzel bun. I ordered mine on a bed of quinoa and greens instead of the bun,mostly because I didn&#39;t want each bite to be a mess. Sometimes, forks are better. This burger truly was the best of it all thanks to the dollop of jalapeno mac n&#39; cheese. So delish! I would definitely recommend this.I had hoped to have room left for a doughnut or some other baked delectable, but it didn&#39;t work out that way. The serving was huge.

All of the sandwiches I tried (monster burger which isn&#39;t listed on the menu, Korean BBQ seitan, Thai BBQ tempeh sandwich) were drowning in sauce, making them not only extremely unhealthy but also difficult to eat without spilling sauce on yourself; the sauce also made the texture really unpleasant. As for the meat substitute itself, I&#39;ve had much better and more flavorful tempeh elsewhere - and it wasn&#39;t doused with sriracha mayo. The pretzel bun in the monster burger was good, but the Thai BBQ sandwich bread was very cheap and flimsy feeling and couldn&#39;t stand up to the sheer amount of sauce in the sandwich.I had high hopes for their doughnuts after hearing so many great things about them, but they were actually even worse. The cranberry glazed one was a super moist, borderline soggy, below average cakey doughnut (the cranberry glaze was good though, but some parts of the glaze were pure sugar). The blackberry fig one was like an extremely tough, dense piece of bread with an admittedly tasty glaze (could definitely taste the fig!). Even split between two people we only managed a few bites.

I appreciate the variety and daily-changing baked goods selection. The donut was absolutely delicious and unique - I&#39;d get it again. It LOOKS dry but it&#39;s not. The Burger was other-worldly. It was full of so many complex flavors and textures. I wish I could order the jalapeno mac and cheese as a full side-item because it was to-die-for.

It is a bit pricey, but the amount of food you get is big enough that you could share. I don&#39;t...but you could.I have even fed non-vegan friends The Beastmode Burger...and their carnivorous tongues liked it!Check it out if you haven&#39;t. The staff is very friendly and patient.

I am not a vegan or vegetarian but I am a yelper who is intrigued by trying new things. I got the Gouchujang Burger, intrigued by how that would even taste, and it was really full of flavor, even if I wasn&#39;t really sure what the flavors were. New and exciting! And very juicy and filling. I had to hold over the wrapper because juice was running out. It was really good and I&#39;m glad it wasn&#39;t trying to taste like beef. If I want beef, I&#39;ll go get it. I wanted something different here.I also got the Hulk Hogan pastry. I&#39;m hesitant to call it a donut because it had no hole. But it was chocolate covered with some chocolate filling. It&#39;s too bad vegans don&#39;t go for milk, because it would have been SO GOOD with a glass of milk. It was really rich and the chocolate on top was just getting all over my face and the napkin I was holding over. I don&#39;t see how anyone could have eaten this from a food truck.I went on Saturday and there was plenty of seating, but I imagine it&#39;s much busier on a weekday lunch. There are a few other businesses in the Pennsy, but this was the most popular when I went. I definitely enjoyed the food, but it is still a pretty expensive lunch comparatively for a casual lunch.

I first tried the beast mode burger which was smokey, spicey, and delicious! The pretzel bun was very tasty and the burger had a hint of coconut bacon! It was honestly amazing.

Their food has many interesting components and layers, which I appreciated.The donuts were soooooo good. I never was a fan of donuts, even when I was non-vegan. However, these were amazing. My favorites were the lemon donut and the peanut butter chocolate cookie dough donut. They both had fillings in them and were incredible. The maple bacon one was kind of one note and simple, to be honest, but it was still tasty! Just not as interesting as the other ones. The brownie was quite sweet, but still good.

I would have to say what stole my heart...or rather my stomach...is their breakfast burrito. Yes that&#39;s right, this place has a breakfast burrito. And it is by far the BEST most delicious vegan breakfast burrito I have ever had in my entire life. So many appetizing flavors packed into one giant perfectly wrapped tortilla oh my gosh. I am literally salivating thinking about it. The only criticism I have with it is the kale. Word of advice...ask for the burrito without it. That kale was very unnecessary and took away from the oh so savory taste of the burrito. But either way...the rest of that burrito was just so good that I would still rate it the best vegan breakfast burrito ever. I also tried the hulk hogan chocolate donut. Man that one definitely did not disappoint either! I was completely shocked when I bit into the middle and a mountain of gooey, sweet dark chocolate started spilling out.

This burger was flavorful but no where near the spice and combination of flavors as the Beastmode.In terms of ambiance, the Pennsy was probably a lot calmer at a lot of other times but I happened to go right before an event at MSG and found it hard to find a place to sit.

So for that I am most grateful to Brooklyn Bagel and whatever is in their water to boast such spectacular carbs for marathon running energy ;)If you aren&#39;t in the mood to wait in line, my tip would be save this spot for an afternoon snack and hit em&#39; when there isn&#39;t a wait.My boyfriend returned the next morning after dropping me to the Staten island ferry and waited around 10 minutes for an everything bagel with egg and cheddar cheese which he also enjoyed.Enjoy!", "Ratings": 4.0, "Reviewcount": "1499", "coolvote": "6", "Usefulvote": "6", "Friendcount": "2850", "funnyvote": "3", "No_of_checkin": "", "No_of_Photos": "2988", "Review_length": 188}, {"Review ": "I&#39;ve always avoided this spot because I&#39;ve walked by and seen lines out the door, but some friends and I finally braved it on a Saturday midday.

To be fair, I was bringing them back to SF.The rainbow bagel kept the same consistency as any normal bagel - just the perfect amount of chewiness without being rubbery or stale, but had an odd scent of sickly sweet fruit loops.

When the acai bowl and coffee was ready, they called me out, and gave me a tray that I brought back to the seating area.The acai bowl was delicious. It tasted freshly-made, and after my first bite, I was very impressed with the addition of the peanut butter. I have never had peanut butter mixed in with acai before! I have had many acai bowls in my lifetime, but this Purple Evil Minion one was very unique. I would definitely recommend it. The coffee was okay, nothing fancy.Overall, I really liked this place.

Personally I felt that the menu could have been clearer/easier to read, and I felt slightly overwhelmed when it came time to order.We tried 2 bagels:- Bacon, egg, &amp; cheese on an onion bagel- Lox, scallion cream cheese, capers, lettuce, tomato on a garlic bagelFirst Impressions:- Amazing (but BIG) portion sizes! Both bagels had plenty of filling, which makes the price more worth it for sure.- Lox (mixed with flavored cream cheese and capers) was way too salty -- personally I felt like this bagel was way too much of a salt bomb, and I kept reaching for my water while trying to eat this. I loved the overall taste, but really wish it was less salty! Honestly I think I wish there was less lox on it, because I tasted it alone and it was the culprit of the salt bomb...had there been a better balance I think I would have enjoyed it more.- Toast your bagel, but be mindful that the outside toppings (i.e. garlic or onions) will likely get burnt in the process, which can take away from the bagel experience.Overall though, I&#39;m glad that I was able to stop by and try this place!

I got a breakfast platter with eggs, sausage and home style potatoes with a toasted bagel with cream cheese for $11. Oh and fresh squeeze OJ. (I&#39;d recommend the other open for OJ. The fresh squeezed one is pretty small.The bagels are pretty big and you could easily share one of their sandwiches. They load on the cream-cheese!

I LOVED IT. How can you visit NY and not get a bagel, right?? That&#39;s what I&#39;ve been told, so I made sure that this trip to NY would be completed with a trip to a bagel shop. My fiance and I were meeting a friend at &#34;Best Bagel&#34; and got there around 915-930am and IT WAS PACKED. Luckily, the line moves very quick. So KNOW before you GO. Because the gentleman that took my order was in the zone! Pro tip: know what this place offers and how you like your bagel before you step in line to order. That will speed up the process. Ordering and getting it in a timely manner isn&#39;t an issue. The big concern is finding a place to sit if you plan on enjoying your luscious bagel at the establishment. There are a few tables and a short countertop that you can eat at, but getting a table and enough chairs will be the struggle. Good luck.The prices are reasonable (bill came out to $14, including my orange juice), considering the massive size of the bagel. I could barely finish my bagel and I was really, really, really, trying to eat everything cause it was just SO GOOD. If you&#39;re in NYC and want a legit bagel to indulge in, I highly recommend that you check this place out. They&#39;ve got breakfast platters and other stuff too, but LOX BAGEL. Just do it.

I asked the cashier for his recommendation and he offered bacon, egg, and cheese on a bagel. You order bagel(s) / sandwich(es) first, then you move on to the next counter and pay together with drinks.After waiting about 10 minutes, I started to wonder why my order took so long. Later I realized that I didn&#39;t pay attention and the staff already called my number.***Coffee (medium, $2.05): Tasted stronger and more bitter than Dunkin&#39; Donuts&#39; coffee with a hint of acidity; a pretty decent cup of coffee.Bacon, Egg, and Cheese (toasted with garlic bagel, $5.60): One of the biggest bagel I have had - bagel was pretty good and it had a nice chewiness to it. Nothing too special about egg, cheese, and bacon - tasted a bit bland. Overall a very filling and healthy (minus bacon) breakfast option.***A pretty solid and &#34;affordable&#34; (using New York standards) grab and go bagel shop for travelers.

The pictures on yelp instantly got me, so we decided to check it out. I got a pizza with baby arugula and prosciutto...from the first bite I knew I found a new home in New York. The crust was paper thin and the sauce was marvelous..so good we had to come twice in a span of 3 days. My girlfriend had a calzone with pancetta chicken and of course mozzarella. It had a little secret ingredient added in there as well some Oregano just to give it that perfect taste for taste buds to go insane. The service was amazing as well the girl at the cashier was very nice and attentive. For a small place in the city I got exactly what I was looking for, a little whole in the wall with lots of love and flavor.

The list of soups for the day are posted outside on the window. More than 15 or 20 options to choose from. Lots of options. People stood in line talking with friends, co-workers. I overheard all sorts of very colorful conversations about office drama, crazy roommate situations, stuff you couldn&#39;t make up!  The line moved quickly like a well oiled machine. Once inside, I asked for 2 samples, like a black bean and sweet potato vegan soup, and the other was green spilt pea soup and ham. I went with the pea soup.

I don&#39;t usually buy the same soup two visits in a row, but this was so good the first time that I got it, I had to get it again when I visited next. It is so smooth, seasoned well, with a reasonable amount of ham here and there (not too much, not too little).Clam Chowder (New England, I think) - I love this soup! I think it is the perfect consistency, not too thick, not too heavy.Boston Clam Chowder - My husband picked this up for me at 4pm after work. Maybe because the soup was from the bottom of the pot, it was a bit thicker than the other chowders, or maybe it is supposed to be that way.Atlantic Seafood Chowder - I think this is my favorite chowder thus far, I like how there are a few pieces of salmon here and there. Again, I like this consistency, not too heavy, not too thick. Well seasoned.Lobster, Shrimp &amp; Salmon Bisque - This soup would be perfect for me if there was less salt. After every two spoonfuls, I had to chase it down with some water, no joke. My husband says that North Americans like their soups more salty. There were a few small pieces of salmon. Again, great taste, excellent consistency, not too heavy, not too thick, just a bit salty for me.Bacon &amp; Scallop Chowder - I enjoyed this when I had it, but it wasn&#39;t that memorable now that I am writing this review retroactively.Minestrone - Disclaimer: I prefer my soups less hearty. This soup was a bit too hearty for me. It had a lot of other stuff - carrots, potatoes, little tubular pasta, cabbage, cauliflower, beans. It certainly felt healthy (healthier than the chowders), but I finished all the soup part, but I had to throw it out with some remaining potatoes, pasta and such.Wild Mushroom Bisque - Compared to the other soups, this is like their &#34;low sodium&#34; soup. It was good, but I felt like it was missing something, like maybe salt and pepper, I totally debated whether to add it on my own. I&#39;ve only had it once, maybe it wasn&#39;t seasoned enough that one time I had it... or maybe it is supposed to be that way.", "Ratings": 5.0, "Reviewcount": "144", "coolvote": "", "Usefulvote": "3", "Friendcount": "65", "funnyvote": "", "No_of_checkin": 0, "No_of_Photos": "100", "Review_length": 430}, {"Review ": "This place reminded me of the soup nazi place Seinfeld.

The suprema and pepperoni slices are actually not that good, and I wouldn&#39;t recommend them. However, they do have some slices which are pretty decent. The vegetarian square, the upside down pepperoni (new) and the fresh mushroom are all really solid choices.The other good things about this place is that there is seating, and that it&#39;s air conditioned. During summers, this is a godsend, but more practically, most other pizzeria joints either don&#39;t feature seating, or if they do, it&#39;s not very good. The tables at suprema are bussed to spotlessness, and it&#39;s very comfortable. There&#39;s also ample seating as well.The one problem with this place is that it&#39;s a little expensive. The fresh mushroom, while pretty good, is an expensive slice for sure at $4.50. It doesn&#39;t surprise me that considering rent right next to Penn station (which has heavy foot traffic), they need to charge relatively high prices for pizza here- so with that considered, it&#39;s probably priced fairly. Still, it is a little expensive for a slice, and probably doesn&#39;t justify you coming from very far away just to try suprema.

The panini had a satisfying crunch to it, and overall sandwich was fantastic.To get to the full groupon amount ($20), I also got a whole wheat croissant with jelly (awesome and almost guilt-free!) and a pistachio-creme croissant (wonderful). To be honest, I actually left without the pistachio croissant and noticed the missing item when I got back to my place in LIC.

This is part of the reason why I waited to write this review for a while, but I believe it is time to do so.I&#39;ve discovered Jonny&#39;s Panini &amp; Coffee Bar a few years ago because of my coffee (but mostly good coffee) addicted coworker. At the time it was still known as Scarpella and tucked away in a tiny spot across the street from B&amp;H, with my company&#39;s office less than a block away.That space was way too small to be able to hold both a coffee and a panini place so I am very glad that Jonny managed to move to a bigger location.There are two main components to this place:1) The coffee. I don&#39;t really drink coffee in general, and if I do it is mostly decaf, yet I can still tell you that the coffee here is both delicious and of high quality. I usually get a decaf mocha which is amazing. Fair warning though: it is highly addictive! Even the biggest coffee snobs will consider the coffee here to be at least decent, I think it is great2) The paninis: When I used to eat meat I would get the grilled chicken panini (Grilled chicken breast, tomato and lettuce with Pesto), it was quite a popular choice and Jonny would sometimes run out of it if I came in after the lunch time rush. More recently I would get the Caprese Panini (Buffalo mozzarella and tomato with Basil Pesto). Both paninis are fantastic, the flavors are relatively simple but they mesh in just the right way. The quality of the paninis is consistent and never left me disappointed.One other warning is that these paninis take time to make, so if you are in a rush to get lunch, this might not be the right place (unless you pre-order).Since I have come here a good amount (mostly with my coworker but sometimes without), I got to talk to Jonny quite a bit and got to know him to a certain extent and what he&#39;s about.Jonny is a very cheerful person but he&#39;s a chef who is very passionate about what he does, cares about the quality of each ingredient and is a crazy perfectionist. He crafted the menu with a lot of care so he does not allow substitutes, which understandably can annoy some people but is fine with me.I should mention that I brought my boyfriend here and he loved his panini as well, so I know that I&#39;m not truly biased, this place deserves all the praise it gets.", "Ratings": 5.0, "Reviewcount": "117", "coolvote": "2", "Usefulvote": "2", "Friendcount": "35", "funnyvote": "", "No_of_checkin": 0, "No_of_Photos": "87", "Review_length": 451}, {"Review ": "For a tiny little joint, this place won&#39;t disappoint !!Great Paninis made with Love.The owner positive and friendly attitude alone is a real pleasure !", "Ratings": 5.0, "Reviewcount": "32", "coolvote": "", "Usefulvote": "2", "Friendcount": "1", "funnyvote": "1", "No_of_checkin": "1", "No_of_Photos": "62", "Review_length": 25}, {"Review ": "This amazing little panini shop is a must!

The sandwiches are good, I will give them that, but the service is enough to deter one from ever returning.A few months back I came here with co-workers where we watched Johnny shamelessly yell at one of his staff members who was helping take orders instead of packing potato chips into to-go bags (it was a busy day). We were shocked to see this self-proclaimed jolly sandwich man treat his staff so poorly, nonetheless in front of a crowd.Another time I placed an online pick-up order. When I went into the shop to pay, I was getting my punch card stamped by a staff member, where he grabbed it out of his hands and screamed &#34;DIS... DIS YOU CANNOT USE FOR PICK UP ORDERS! NEVER AGAIN!&#34; His delivery was absolutely awful but I just laughed it off.Today was the icing on the cake for me. Upon stumbling into here for lunch, I was denied - yes, DENIED service from the King JP himself. When I asked to substitute my sauce (as I usually do), he waved his finger in my face saying &#34;No, no, no, as the board says we do NOT do substitutions.&#34; I calmly stated back, &#34;Are you sure? I have done this before&#34;. &#34;NO, NO.. NOT AT JONNY PANINI AND CERTAINLY NOT FROM ME, JONNY!&#34; he yelled back. We went back and forth a few times when I eventually gave up &amp; walked out - he didn&#39;t even try to stop me from leaving or offering another item on the menu I would have maybe liked.Mind you, the place was empty and I was the only customer in there. I am not sure why he could not make this simple swap for me, it&#39;s not like I was asking for his first born. Are the sandwiches pre-made that he could not make this simple request? Makes me question the freshness of his items. He could not give me a logical explanation as to why.It&#39;s clear that this man does not know how to treat his staff, and sadly his customers too. He lost my business today along with everyone in my office who has had similar experiences with his pompous &amp; condescending ways. You will also notice he does not have consistent people working there - I wonder why...There are plenty of great sandwich shops in the area (sergimmo salumeria, la panineria) who know how to treat their customers right. This is a disgruntled man who only cares about the dollars in his pocket and his wall mural. If you have to order from them, do yourself a favor and order online so you don&#39;t have to have any human interaction with this man. What. a. shame.**UPDATE: after this review posted, Jonny took the time to message me on Yelp. Instead of trying to rectify the situation, he only continued to insult me, told me to go eat at Subway, and that he yells because it&#39;s in his blood... &#34;he&#39;s Italian&#34; (his words, not mine). He also told me I lied about ordering sandwiches in the past that had substitutions and that I should learn to be honest. (?!) If this doesn&#39;t capture the type of person this man is, I don&#39;t know what else will. His passive comment below also proves how this man cannot address a problem that is clearly evident in his business practices.He also threatened two other woman here on Yelp to remove their negative reviews - which I know because they private messaged me thanking me that I wrote such a honest review and they unfortunately had similar experiences.

What was immediately noticeable was that everything is lacking sauce. The chicken was particularly hard to eat as it was dry, and with little sauce it was hard going down. The bulgolgi had decent flavor but was also dry. The kimchi fried rice was also dry, and the flavor too mild. The only thing that wasn&#39;t dry was the tteok-bokki because it is in a sea of sauce. If all you&#39;re getting right is putting your tteok-bokki in sauce, then you&#39;re doing it wrong.This meal was not worth $13.00. The portions for each item are small, the taste is mediocre at best, and the sauces are all lacking.

The japchae was wonderful, the noodles were cooked well and the vegetables inside were great.The best part of it all - the kimchi jiggae soup. Wow!

And it was good kimchi fried rice.For the entrees on top, I got the spicy chicken, which seemed like chicken stewed in a red gochujang-based sauce, and the crispy tofu, which was blocks of fried tofu in a tasty ginger scallion sauce. My husband got the bulgogi and the ddukboki (rice cakes), both of which were also good. If I had to pick favorites, it would probably be the spicy chicken and the bulgogi, but I did like how the tofu balanced out the heavier seasoned chicken in the bowl I got.

All of the sandwiches I tried (monster burger which isn&#39;t listed on the menu, Korean BBQ seitan, Thai BBQ tempeh sandwich) were drowning in sauce, making them not only extremely unhealthy but also difficult to eat without spilling sauce on yourself; the sauce also made the texture really unpleasant. As for the meat substitute itself, I&#39;ve had much better and more flavorful tempeh elsewhere - and it wasn&#39;t doused with sriracha mayo. The pretzel bun in the monster burger was good, but the Thai BBQ sandwich bread was very cheap and flimsy feeling and couldn&#39;t stand up to the sheer amount of sauce in the sandwich.I had high hopes for their doughnuts after hearing so many great things about them, but they were actually even worse. The cranberry glazed one was a super moist, borderline soggy, below average cakey doughnut (the cranberry glaze was good though, but some parts of the glaze were pure sugar).

Everything from meats, seafood, a bar, etc. Cinnamon Snail is the only full-vegan shop inside of the Pennsy. You order and then sit inside the shared space within the Pennsy, almost like a high-end cafeteria. As a vegan dating a non-vegan, we really valued this set up since we each got to get the food we preferred, but still sit and eat together. The interior was aesthetically pleasing, lit up with beautiful natural lighting.The servers at the counter of the cinnamon snail were very friendly and welcoming. They were attentive to my questions and answered appropriately.I ordered the beast mode burger and the raspberry cheesecake donut. The food menu is minimal, so I had a somewhat easy time choosing the burger. But the sweets selection is so extensive that I had a difficult time just choosing one item. I appreciate the variety and daily-changing baked goods selection. The donut was absolutely delicious and unique - I&#39;d get it again. It LOOKS dry but it&#39;s not. The Burger was other-worldly. It was full of so many complex flavors and textures. I wish I could order the jalapeno mac and cheese as a full side-item because it was to-die-for. The pretzel bun took everything to another level.Prices were on the higher end ($11.02 burger, $3.50 donut) but I suppose I can justify it with 1) The burger was soo filling and 2) artisanal donut. I guess it depends on who you&#39;re asking.My only gripe maybe would be the wait time, but since I arrived right at opening, I didn&#39;t face that issue.

The donut dough itself was a nice balance between a cake and yeast donut; just enough density, but not too light as to fall flat from the puree placed on top.Onto the oddly named &#34;Hulk Hogan&#34; donut, whose display had a placard with the words &#34;Fudgy Wudgy&#34;.This seemingly small looking donut was quite heavy in weight as it was a good 40%+ filled with an absolutely great tasting fudge (just look at my photo of the donut cut in half). Not to be overlooked was the nice crumbly chocolate topping which added a pleasant crunch. The donut itself was soft, fairly light, with a nice slightly honey-like flavor.Absolutely delicious, and I would buy this one again and again.Overall, I noticed the prices of the donuts to be up there (ranging from $2.25 for a non-filled donut to $3.50 for a filled one, like the &#34;Hulk Hogan&#34;), but each of the donuts I tried were of super high quality in flavor and appearance.Of note is that Cinnamon Snail has a food truck which frequents Red Bank NJ during the weekends, so Red Bank being closer to home, this revelation just made my day!", "Ratings": 5.0, "Reviewcount": "281", "coolvote": "3", "Usefulvote": "3", "Friendcount": "130", "funnyvote": "1", "No_of_checkin": "1", "No_of_Photos": "1068", "Review_length": 271}, {"Review ": "I used to say Vegan??

I am literally salivating thinking about it. The only criticism I have with it is the kale. Word of advice...ask for the burrito without it. That kale was very unnecessary and took away from the oh so savory taste of the burrito. But either way...the rest of that burrito was just so good that I would still rate it the best vegan breakfast burrito ever. I also tried the hulk hogan chocolate donut.

Usually when I think of vegetarian sandwich shops, they revolve around bland burgers and faux meat but The Cinnamon Snail was the exact opposite. I got both the Red Curry Grilled Tofu and Beastmode Burger which were both phenomenal. The Beastmode Burger was definitely one of the best burgers I have ever had. Beware that it is quite spicy, but as an avid mac and cheese lover, I think this is hands down the better of the two burgers I ate. The other burger I had was the Red Curry burger. This burger was flavorful but no where near the spice and combination of flavors as the Beastmode.In terms of ambiance, the Pennsy was probably a lot calmer at a lot of other times but I happened to go right before an event at MSG and found it hard to find a place to sit. Keep in mind that these burgers are definitely not tiny and can be quite messy so maybe coming here right before an event isn&#39;t the greatest idea, but regardless I enjoyed my burgers thoroughly.

The atmosphere you get at ALT is that people come here to relax, take a break from work, talk, and enjoy the city.Most customers do not stay so the three stools they have for sitting are surprisingly available if you do need somewhere to sit down for a bit.The current employees (Jake, Cooper, to name a few) are very good at remembering regulars and providing great conversation and good communication.

I usually get mine for takeout from this location; although it&#39;s closer to my home than the other location, I usually scarf it down before I get home!Considering that the world&#39;s oceans are being overfished, vegan sushi is something more people should consider having; Beyond Sushi makes it easy, fun, and delicious!", "Ratings": 5.0, "Reviewcount": "695", "coolvote": "1", "Usefulvote": "1", "Friendcount": "483", "funnyvote": "1", "No_of_checkin": "6", "No_of_Photos": "1181", "Review_length": 132}, {"Review ": "So good and fresh, we tried the spicy mang, nutty buddy, and might mushroom and the fun guy dumplings (one of THE most unique things I have ever tasted!).Definitely a spot we will go back to next year!", "Ratings": 4.0, "Reviewcount": "96", "coolvote": "", "Usefulvote": "", "Friendcount": "20", "funnyvote": "", "No_of_checkin": 0, "No_of_Photos": "10", "Review_length": 38}, {"Review ": "The first think I have to mention about this place is the service.

I also wish that you were offered water and there was a bathroom, which is particularly inconvenient when you&#39;re a tourist (less so if you&#39;re a local). So really this is definitely a good place for getting a delicious meal to-go, but just a heads up if you&#39;re trying to sit in and eat.

Needless to say, sushi is never my first choice. But Beyond Sushi flips the table. I could eat lunch here every week for the rest of my life and still be excited about it each time. Everything looks delicious, but I opted for the Mighty Mushroom and it was amazing! It&#39;s the truffle fries of fish-less sushi. It has that powerful umami addictiveness in the sauce with the subtle nuttiness of nori and sushi rice and mushroom pieces. Plus, it&#39;s beautifully plated!The lunch specials (sushi + soup/salad/side) save you a dollar or so, but if you didn&#39;t want a soup or side salad to begin with that discount isn&#39;t really tempting enough to lure you from getting a drink or brownie instead. Or spending $7 on lunch instead of $10.The cucumber lemonade was too sweet for me, but if you&#39;re craving something sugary it&#39;s not bad. If you&#39;re getting it to go, I imagine would also be GREAT 1:1 with seltzer (or a cheeky gin &amp; tonic/seltzer combo).Service is amiable and efficient-- almost too efficient! Our food was ready before two seats had opened up, so we had to awkwardly stand around waiting for someone to leave before eating.

I am a recent Vegan whole food plant based eater. As the meat eater that I once was, I thought it&#39;d be extremely difficult to match the tastiness with vegan meals. However, this place has blown me away. This completely destroys this notion, and thinking that animal based foods are far more superior than plant based foods from a taste perspective.My girlfriend and I have been wanting to try this place for quite sometime. We were greeted generously by staff, and were given a menu to explore our options.We ordered the Chick Pea Roll, the Green Machine, and the Sweet Tree. Aside from the sushi rolls being appealing to the eye, the taste is out of this world. My girlfriend and I have come to a consensus that our favorite roll is the Green Machine; from the rice, to the vegetables, to the sweet sauce topping, it all blends well to give this astounding mix of flavor.After reading some other reviews, many people have recommended the Mighty Mushroom as their favorite, so that will be next order. I also ordered their mushroom soup. There isn&#39;t much to comment on it, other than that it is really spicy and will fill you up quick.

I sampled the latter of those two and it was refreshingly awesome.Despite this, my go to tiramisu was the final decision. A little strong in flavor, but definitely tasted like it was made with detail. The gelato gal got two scoops and split it between stracciatella and matcha. An odd combo, though each one held some great, sweet taste.

You know, I really wanted to love Freco Gelateria given the positive reviews more or less across the entire spectrum, and while it may have been because I came in on the late side, the gelato that I had really was pretty easily trumped by a lot of the other gelato and ice cream I&#39;ve had in the city (M&#39;o Gelato, Van Leeuwen, etc.)Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?I will say that while the product was sub-par in my opinion, the atmosphere at Fresco was excellent. The shape of the place is a bit unorthodox, but it allows for seating whether it&#39;s just you looking to get some work done while you enjoy a frozen treat or if you&#39;ve a full group in tow. The display is beautiful and the gelato itself displayed in a really unique manner. Star Granted.Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?$5.50 is about right for two scoops these days, and that&#39;s what I paid at Fresco, opting for Chocolate Brownie and Salted Caramel. Star Granted.Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?Honestly? It just wasn&#39;t that great. Both of my flavors were quite a bit more frozen than gelato should be, and the result was small ice crystals diluting the flavor and more or less offsetting that smooth creamy texture that distinguishes gelato from ice cream.From there, neither flavor really blew me away even though these are flavors that I traditionally love. The chocolate was better than the caramel, but even that didn&#39;t impress in that it lacked that sort of deep and rich flavor that you might find elsewhere. Maybe an off night, but I really wasn&#39;t impressed. No Stars Granted.Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?Maybe I caught Fresco on an off night, but with such stiff competition in the immediate area, I simply can&#39;t say I&#39;d make Fresco a common spot.

Also the Trump-bashing artwork in the front of the shop is a plus.", "Ratings": 5.0, "Reviewcount": "73", "coolvote": "3", "Usefulvote": "1", "Friendcount": "220", "funnyvote": "1", "No_of_checkin": 0, "No_of_Photos": "117", "Review_length": 140}, {"Review ": "this Mexican cafe has amazing tortas, however the majority of the time i ask for the #huevoconchorizo in a bowl- the chef knows exactly how I like it, and tops it with a little guacamole!", "Ratings": 5.0, "Reviewcount": "37", "coolvote": "1", "Usefulvote": "2", "Friendcount": "383", "funnyvote": "", "No_of_checkin": 0, "No_of_Photos": "32", "Review_length": 35}, {"Review ": "Carnitas torta hit the spot!

The place wasn&#39;t too packed so I was able to order right away--btw, this place is not only a restaurant, it also houses some interesting cookbooks, jellies, and other assorted items that are worth perusing through.At the suggestion of the cashier, I decided to go with the carnitas sammy. The sandwich came to about $9 (with the 10% off Yelp check in) and was a decent size. The meat was very tender and flavorful and paired nicely with the bun. My only complaint was that I wish they had included more pickled onions on my sandwich, but otherwise it was fantastic.

I tried the &#39;Carnitas&#39; (recommended by Marcos) and I loved it. I never tried a sandwich with beans before, but it fit so well with the cheese and the meat. I also tried my friend&#39;s vegetarian sandwich and that was amazing as well, although the meat one was better for my taste. I would definitely come here again not just for the food, but also for the amazing service! Marcos and Victor were both wonderful. My friend and I didn&#39;t know that the place closed at 7pm until we saw them cleaning up and realized they let us stay 30-40 min past their closing time. I thought it was so nice of them to not intrude our conversation and kick us out.

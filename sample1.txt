[{"Review ": "I had just binged all weekend on booze, and was about to indulge in a Sunday Funday. I needed some sort of food, and wanted it to be healthy. This was the closest thing to Penn Station I could find... so the location is key.I couldn&#39;t decide what to get, so the friendly baristas were able to help me decide and were knowledgeable about the food. I got the kale/avocado egg white omelette...I didn&#39;t even know avocado could be in an omelette, but at this point I don&#39;t know if I can ever have an omelette the same again. The serving was massive, fresh, fluffy, and was by far the best omelette I ever got. I also got a fresh juice (Saw them make it in front of me) and got all my nutrients before I went for a day of shots (sorry I&#39;m not sorry).The decor is relaxed, bright, rustic, earthy... but still feels like a chic NYC place. The service is exceptional. My only negative is that the price is high... but then again its NYC, so its likely on par with evertyhing else.", "Ratings": 5.0, "Reviewcount": "599", "coolvote": "1", "Usefulvote": "", "Friendcount": "238", "funnyvote": "1", "No_of_checkin": "", "No_of_Photos": "118", "Review_length": 186}]

This concept has become so famous among the cart owners, that one of them has actually named his cart after it. &#34;Tony Draggin&#39;us.&#34; Of course because he&#39;s a Halal Cart owner, he spelled it wrong, hence &#34;Tony Dragonas.&#34;What to get: Shish Kebab PlateWhat else: Combo or anythingAnything else: My bum bum is on fire, and the next paragraph will explain whySo I know the real reason for the name of this cart. Which is that if you put too much hot sauce on this thingy, then your bottom will be on fire. Hence &#34;Dragon Ass.&#34; Get it? Now you understand.So NYC is full of absolutely amazing Halal Carts. And when you say Goodbye, I say Halal. Halal, Halal. I don&#39;t know why you say goodbye, I say Halal. And this one is one of the very best there is. It&#39;s definitely top 10 in NYC, and may even be top 5. It&#39;s a little behind Sammy&#39;s Halal and Biryani Cart, and it&#39;s competing with the likes of King Of Falafel (Queens), Halal Guys, Uncle Gussy&#39;s and Halal Guys. So I&#39;d say yes, it would just about make the top 5.I don&#39;t know why the owner is so angry though. You should come here with us some time, if only to hear &#34;Tony Rag-on-us.&#34; He really does. Except that I don&#39;t appreciate that expression, so please don&#39;t use it at home, kids, just because you saw me do it. Damn I feel like Eminem right now. Y&#39;all act like you never seen a white person before.The reason Tony is so good is that he has a huge p***s. Oh wait. That&#39;s a different Tony. No, the reason it&#39;s so good is that it&#39;s made with wonderful high quality ingredients. The salad is well put together and fresh. The rice is delectable and buttery and tasty. And the meat is the absolute star of the show. I&#39;m not even a huge Shish fan, but Tony said I should try his Shish, which is cubes of lamb or beef steak, marinaded and cooked on a skewer. He was damn right. This is some of the juiciest, tastiest meat I&#39;ve tried before. I was absolutely floored by how damn good it was. Bravo, Tony. Bravo.If this place sold Argentinian food, it&#39;d be renamed to &#34;Tony Patagonias&#34; but it doesn&#39;t. Which is a shame because Argentinian food is f***ing awesome.I want to send a massive shout out (as usual) to my friend Kashif for recommending this particular cart so vehemently and emphatically that I ended up finding my way here, and absolutely loved it. I will be back again for sure, and Kashif definitely earned Tony another customer, so well done K.And if this were &#34;Tony Slagonus&#34; it would be about me and several male friends with a rather rough, rather promiscuous British girl atop us.

Better than any Greek Restaurant I&#39;ve ever been to for sure.Sorry I have no photos, we attacked the food so fast, no time to snap a nice shot. But there are plenty of photos here on Yelp of Lamb Gyros, Platters, and all kinds of good stuff. Put this on your NY to do list. The food was piping hot, and you can easily take it to go for a nice picnic in Central Park.

It is like wow this is the most amazing cold sandwich I ever have.If you ordered through any apps, you will need to ask them or you will be standing there waiting without knowing when your sandwich will be ready. There is not enough chairs for everyone to sit and eat; that is why there another sign says you can sit at the bakery next door which is also own by them.

Tip - Pisillo also has a bakery, so depending on what direction you&#39;re walking from, be careful to not to enter the bakery. If you did enter the bakery like me, fear not because the sandwich store is literally next door.I went with the pisillo as a sandwich named after its storefront has to be good - plus the ingredients of porchetta and prosciutto already won me over.

The mozzarella and sweet peppers added a great layer of flavor as well. Oh and as for the case of wasted bread? It actually worked out for the best as the sandwich missing some bread was pretty heavy, so I couldn&#39;t imagine how more stuffed I could have been with the extra bread.At ~$16, the ability to feed two, and the quality, Pisillo is a steal.

The place was uncrowded this late afternoon. I decided on number 26: The &#34;Pisillo&#34; ($13.9) which had Prosciutto di Parma, Porchetta, Bufala Mozzarella, Roasted Peppers, Arugula, and a Balsamic Dressing. I opted for the Sfilatino Bread ($1 extra). I initially thought the $16 cash only price tag was a bit steep for sandwich but I was mistaken.First, the bread comes fresh daily from Brooklyn. Sfilatino is the Italian equivalent to the French baguette. It is oven baked in a long narrow shape. It has a crunchy exterior, very little crumb, and packed with flavor. It was a little tough to chew through so next time I want to try the Semolina Bread which looked more tender.Second, the remaining ingredients are all high end and imported from Italy to persevere that Italian flavor. The slab of prosciutto was sliced razor thin and layered on my sandwich right in front of me. Next they added Porchetta which was mouth-wateringly salty and fatty. The fresh mozzarella add a creamy quality. The sweet peppers added a nice sweetness and texture. The arugula provided freshness. The homemade Balsamic based dressing moisten the palate.Third, the sandwich is a huge. It is easily two meals and I eat a lot. They don&#39;t skimp out on the meat or cheese either. The price is three times more expensive than subway but ten times the quality.This is definitely a place to check out.

Let&#39;s start with my favorite item on the menu. The gyro. They really pack it up! Make sure you get everything on it! I love the salt, lemon and potatoes that go in it! The souvlaki is good too (Try it with barbecue sauce and oregano!), and the platters with pita bread are so yummy! Just be warned that the platter comes with a lot of food! Again, great value for what you&#39;re getting!Lines here can get pretty long, but they move quickly. It&#39;s a pretty popular spot. The staff is extremely friendly, and are willing to go out of their way to find you seating if you&#39;d like to stay by the truck and eat. Even during a rainy day like they did for me!

Chicken perfectly cooked without necessarily being dry. Lemon juice elevated the depth of the chicken. Killer Tatziki sauce (read: white crack sauce) and of course the customary yellow rice! Spread a little amount of the white crack sauce with the chicken, take a spoon of yellow rice put them in your mouth, start chewing and close your eyes! *Nirvana state reached-satisfaction guaranteed*. Even the tomato and onion has some nice tangy flavors, making the forgettable dreaded bed of greens that sitting below the rice more bearable and memorable. Orange Greek Soda tasted just like another Orange Fanta (but still good though)Generous portion -- The rice platter portion will feed big eater comfortably. For me, this platter can serve 2 meals - so I am all set for lunch &amp; dinner!Great service -- Service is quick and prompt. The lady took over my order and she made sure to smile along the way (even though it was a pretty busy lunch time when I came)Then why only 4 stars?

That was me.My review is probably harsh and nitpicky but I can list other restaurants that have outdone EMP in different areas.4 star service - wait staffs were attentive but they fell short personalization and synchronization.A)  Personalization - before arriving, EMP contacts you to see if it&#39;s a special occasion, if you have any food allergies or dietary restrictions. We went there for our anniversary and not that I am looking for complimentary toast or dessert but no one mentioned or congratulated us on our anniversary. That was a minor miss. The bigger misses were in the beginning. The wait staff asked again if we had any food allergies or food aversion. We said no. But the survey was already taken the day before so it would be nice for the staff to reconfirm our answer rather than re-asking the same question we already answered.B)  Synchronization - this is an observation on the party of 6 table in front of us where plates were not served in sync. It was a table of 3 ladies and 3 gentlemen with 3 wait staff serving. The plates came out the same time but placing it on the table was off and at one point a gentleman was served first before the plate was served to the lady (Big Gasp right?!?). This SUPER nitpicky but I always remember how well Del Posto executed their plate-serving synchronization when we went as a group of 5.3 star food/menu - there were no physical menus presented but the server spoke about the options. I personally appreciate visually seeing what&#39;s on the menu and the components in the dish so I can be more engaged with my dishes incase I have questions on the ingredients. The food itself was good but it was nothing mind blowing except for the caviar dish for me. That was amazing! The food in general was good but not memorable. It was bland and maybe it&#39;s the menu served that day but it&#39;s missing complexity. That especially goes for the lobster dish which is essentially the tail plus some bisque which by the way my husband had a piece of shell on his dish. The presentation was lacking. Same plates were used throughout the meal and nothing creative with plating. Our wine pairing glasses had more character than the plates. Per Se definitely takes the cake in everything but especially in presentation. One negative note on the food is the duck. I&#39;m a huge duck fan and whenever that&#39;s an option on the menu, that would be my go to. I felt mine was overcooked and had to send it back for a more medium/pink center one. The replacement one came and it was still over cooked to the point where it was super hard for me to cut with the smooth edge knife they served it with. I felt a serrated knife would be a more proper utensil pairing but they did not have any in the restaurant.4 star cocktail drinks - drinks were good and good presentation but of course it doesn&#39;t compare drinks at Flatiron Room, Raines Law Room, etc.3 star ambiance/dcor - the space is big and open with very high ceilings with a modern look but it&#39;s not warm, engaging or stimulating. For a good ambiance dcor restaurant, Daniel would be the top contender for me.", "Ratings": 3.0, "Reviewcount": "138", "coolvote": "", "Usefulvote": "", "Friendcount": "15", "funnyvote": "", "No_of_checkin": 0, "No_of_Photos": "24", "Review_length": 579}, {"Review ": "I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m giving &#34;The Best Restaurant in the World&#34; a 4 star rating. Completely missing the WOW factor you expect as far as food is concerned. And I&#39;m usually extremely generous with 5 star ratings. But if you&#39;re going to be #1 you have to really be #1. Honestly the ambiance, service, and attention to detail is top top. It&#39;s why they&#39;re rated what they are. But the food was only good! It&#39;s so disappointing! I expected flavors, dishes I&#39;d wish I could try again but wouldn&#39;t be able to until I somehow came back here. Not 1. If it wasn&#39;t for the service I&#39;d say my rating would be a 3, maybe even a 2 because of price. I think the missing factor was that the food was bland. In fact the newly renovated venue was pretty bland and underwhelming as well.Now for the positives! Did a tour of the kitchen, it&#39;s totally calm and huge and clean and beautiful. Real masterpiece back there since the renovations. There&#39;s a real relaxing vibe to the place, that was great. You also get about 10 different servers come to you throughout the night, felt like we were hosted by the whole kitchen - staff really cares about what they do and take it super seriously. That was nice. I think they also do a great job of accommodating. If I had an allergy, or didn&#39;t like a certain type of food, you get the impression they&#39;ll drive over to McDonald&#39;s to get you a burger if that&#39;s what they think you really want and to accommodate you. Unfortunately I eat everything and I&#39;m not a picky difficult person so I couldn&#39;t benefit personally from that level of accommodation they definitely excel at.Bottom line: they need to rethink their tasting menu because if you&#39;re #1, you can&#39;t have ok dishes.

It was as if they pumped more oxygen into the room to keep me calm and relaxed just by being there.This review is hard for me because I am honestly not sure whether to give 4 or 5 stars. Despite everything being good, there was only 1 dish that I thought was truly amazing flavor-wise. And that was their mushroom dish. Everything else was extremely visually appealing and the whole experience was wonderful, but as a true foodie it is tough for me to give them a perfect 5.The way in which each dish is presented definitely gave me moments of awe as I sat there mesmerized at the presentation and manipulation of common ingredients brought about in different ways.Note: Everything was good but only 1 was greatAs for the service and experience it is definitely 5 stars for me. At the end of the meal, they give you your personalized tasting menu written in the order of presentation alongside some oats for breakfast the next day. One of the things that gave me such an added boost is that there is no dress code!!! Yes no dress code!! Just be comfortable!Overall, I highly recommend anyone who is willing to spend a little, to give this place a try as the experience is dazzling, the servers are friendly, and they make you feel like victorian age nobility.

We had been following the remodel of EMP and were really looking forward to our meal. We left very satiated with no regrets.The ultimate takeaway of our experience was that for the cost, it was worth it, but only for a nice occasion. Would I necessarily be able to justify the high cost for just an average night - absolutely not. And for the high cost, was everything done impeccably? Close, but not quite. I&#39;ve had equally great food at a lower price point (eg, $150 pp vs $300 pp), but where EMP really sets itself above the rest is service. There was never a moment that we felt forgotten about. Napkins were folded, surfaces cleaned, shawls were delivered (for us perpetually shivering ladies!), and tablecloths were ironed (literally!). In terms of the food, at that cost and at 3 Michelin stars, I really expected to be WOW&#39;d by every single dish. Unfortunately, this was just not the case.STANDOUTS:- Starter bites: compressed apples dipped in foie gras caramel with apple almond crumble. Who would have known that tart apple and the sweetness of the caramel could be so well complimented by smooth and rich foie gras?!- Smoked sturgeon cheesecake with caviar: this one was communally served and an absolute showstopper! it tasted like an ultra luxurious bagel with lox and looked a million bucks. Could have taken it without the pickled cucumbers.- Seared warm foie gras dish with beets: This course was presented with various other options (clams with fennel, mushroom carpaccio, or the cold foie gras preparation with cabbage). I ended up choosing the clams, but this to me was the CLEAR winner. I would try to explain all the components of the dish, but frankly I am not sure (aside from the beets, there was a crunch component), and it was just indescribable. This is hands down one of the best things I&#39;ve ever tasted!- Roasted duck with honey and lavender: beautiful and impeccably executed from head to toe. The duck with succulent and juicy and the crusted skin with salt and honey provided just the right amount of texture to the dish.COULD HAVE DONE WITHOUT:- Starter bites: sweet potato tart. They compared it to a sweet potato pie when describing to us, but honestly it was a very sad, black sheep version. I feel like there are so many better things that can be done with a sweet potato.- Clams with fennel: while visually beautiful and labor intensive, I just found the taste to be one note: surfer clams, with clam mouse, and dill. It felt like it was missing something and it was not the most pleasing texture.- Kale seasonal side with egg yolk: There was something underneath the kale (perhaps a kale puree) that was a very deep green color with a bitter taste and displeasing texture. Honestly, I wasn&#39;t sure what it was and it was the only thing we ate all night that was left on the plate.- Wine pairings: Unfortunately, we were not impressed by a majority of the pairings chosen and would probably do without this the next time around.For the experience as a whole (food, service, kitchen tour), we had a great night. But for the overall bill, it just felt like there were certain areas that could have been improved. For $300 a person, I think the kabocha squash course and cheddar with pretzel and beer could be improved/elevated (lovely, just not something I would expect at this pricepoint). However, the personalization and take home gifts were certainly nice touches and I would absolutely recommend EMP to everyone looking to have a nice night out.", "Ratings": 4.0, "Reviewcount": "190", "coolvote": "", "Usefulvote": "2", "Friendcount": "169", "funnyvote": "", "No_of_checkin": 0, "No_of_Photos": "814", "Review_length": 628}, {"Review ": "Excellent. 10/10 I loved everything about my experience here.

The service is great off the bat. Everyone is so friendly and wanting to make your dining experience memorable. The overall atmosphere was casual and not as stuck up as I thought it would be.With the tasting menu, we tried a variety of dishes. The most memorable for me was the celery root being cooked inside an animal&#39;s stomach I believe, and they do this at your table. Another great dish was their oysters which was served two ways on one plate: savory and sweet. So delectable. My favorite though was the lobster dish. Bursting with flavor and perfectly cooked. I liked their savory dishes more than the sweet. As we go through each dish, I notice their flavors are more traditional. I tasted a lot of maple syrup and apple flavors in multiple courses, but the presentation is always creative and out of the box.As a final treat after all that good food, they also gave us some homemade granola to go as a nice parting gift.

Well, I stand corrected, EMP has definitely earned its title as best restaurant in the world (per 2017&#39;s San Pellegrino&#39;s list). For those of you that like me, may have been living under a rock these last several years, EMP offers an 11-course tasting menu (estimated to take about 3.5 hours to get through) and a policy of asking for payment when the reservation is booked (leaving you to only pay for your drinks on the night of the reservation). Since EMP is slated to close this summer in order to undergo huge kitchen and dining room reservations, the menu they are currently offering is their greatest hits dishes from over the year.Every dish was amazing. From the simpler (in presentation anyway) dishes such as gougeres with grated gruyere to grinding up carrots tableside for their carrot tartare dish or serving a turbot with zucchini scales, everything was phenomenal. My personal favority was a foie gras torchon which maple syrup on the inside.The service was top notch as well. I asked for one of the hostess&#39;s where the ladies room and waited for her to give the regular &#34;turn right/left and walk down the corridor...&#34; instructions. But not at EMP. Here I was escorted all the way to the door of the ladies room.The pacing of the meal was excellent as well. Since it was just two of us for dinner and we didn&#39;t end up drinking, we finished up after about 2.5 hours. However, it seemed that we were not the norm as we finished far in advance of the other tables that were leisurely enjoying their wine pairing, etc.My favorite part of the meal had to be our interaction with the general manager(?) at the end. We ordered tableside tea (more curious about what that entailed than anything else) and were treated with a wonderful presentation where he discussed and demonstrated a one versus three-steeping process and answered our questions about the restaurant renovations and what would happen to the staff (they are opening a pop-up restaurant over the summer in the Hampton&#39;s and a major driver of that decision was to provide employment to their best asset... their people).Lastly, they finished off the meal with offering us a complementary glass of brandy for my husband and sparkling (non-alcoholic) cider for me. I was very impressed with how well they were paying attention. My husband had ordered 1-drink at the bar while (due to a crappy cold) I ordered two non-alcoholic drinks and mostly drank water at the table. The waitstaff, with everything else going on, was able to notice that my husband would be inclined to drink the brandy, while correctly surmising that I would need to go the non-alcoholic route.The final impressive touch came with our parting gift. Most of the high-end restaurants are now in the habit of providing an extra food treat to take home and EMP was no exception, except that instead of a tiny tin of cookies or chocolate, we received two large glass canisters of granola.", "Ratings": 5.0, "Reviewcount": "47", "coolvote": "7", "Usefulvote": "13", "Friendcount": "73", "funnyvote": "4", "No_of_checkin": "", "No_of_Photos": "159", "Review_length": 531}, {"Review ": "I had been several years ago and was a bit underwhelmed but decided to make a reservation in the bar for dinner since it reopened.

Unfortunately, here is my honest review of the place.Before I even go into the details, let me start by saying this is indeed an amazing restaurant. But if it is deemed the best of the best, then I will hold it by those standards. It did fall short of those expectations and as such, I&#39;m giving it a 3 star rating. It may be harsh, but you&#39;re spending a significant amount for an incredible experience so you have to be better than just better than the next guy.Pros:- Even before you get to the restaurant, someone personally reaches out to you to make sure everything is perfect. It&#39;s a great personal touch.- There were some great dishes, the lobster bisque sauce was perfect. The pretzel was amazing. I also really enjoyed the veal.- The staff is very friendly and mostly attentive.- The kitchen tour was a nice touch, especially to show off the new set upCons:- The dinner is too long. I believe it was purposely done as to not make you feel rushed but the courses had 30 minute gaps in some places. We had a 6:15 start and didn&#39;t finish until around 10:20.- The dishes were good but not amazing. I can&#39;t honestly say any one dish blew me away.- At one point, one of the servers spilled my wine glass on me. Now this wasn&#39;t a big deal on its own, as mistakes happen. It was more of how it was handled that was a bit upsetting for a restaurant of this caliber. So after she spilled the wine on my jacket, she picked up the glass and placed it back on my table. She apologized and handed me a towel. Another member of the waitstaff also came over to help clean up and hand me additional towels. All great until I look up and see my empty and sticky wine glass sitting on the table. I&#39;m not expecting a freebie but I&#39;ve been to much lesser restaurants where they would come back with a new glass at least. At the end, I had to ask for a new one myself. Normally not a huge deal, but if you&#39;re the best restaurant in the world...Overall, EMP is a great dining establishment and anyone would be lucky to go.

However, from the moment we stepped into EMP, our magical evening began on a great foot by the immaculate decor and the impeccable service.We opted for a 5 course vegetarian tasting menu with wine pairings for our Valentine&#39;s Day meal. My husband had surprised me with an all-Riesling wine pairing (my favorite wine), which was an added bonus! Some of the Rieslings that were part of this pairing ranged from $150/bottle-over $400/bottle, so you can imagine how delicious and wonderfully paired our meal was. Onto the food, which was quite possibly, the most flavorful meal I&#39;ve ever had. What I enjoyed most about the vegetarian tasting menu was that the food may have looked somewhat simple at first glance, but once you took a bite of food, you quickly realized how much complexity and depth of flavors and textures was hidden in every bite. I absolutely loved the cauliflower play on caviar, the sweet potato with jus, the kohlrabi salad, and the mushroom risotto!There were also small touches that made the experience extremely personalized and distinguished it from other high-end restaurants, such as, the private tour of the kitchen, complete with a cocktail, the sea salt pretzel and cocktail at the end of the meal, and the granola parting gift (best granola ever!!).My husband and I have already decided we are going to be back for the 10-12 course pairing menu the next time we&#39;re in NYC!", "Ratings": 5.0, "Reviewcount": "94", "coolvote": "", "Usefulvote": "1", "Friendcount": "25", "funnyvote": "", "No_of_checkin": 0, "No_of_Photos": "24", "Review_length": 299}, {"Review ": "I don&#39;t typically leave reviews for places outside of my yelp territory but this place definitely deserves the praise.I&#39;ve read about Eleven Madison Park for years, saw it kept its 3 Michelin stars AND made #3 best restaurant in the WORLD this year.

We had just finished a trip to Napa and perhaps we had been spoiled, but nearly every place we went, they somehow acknowledged this point with a complimentary toast or small dessert or even a congratulatory note in the end. Now if you go somewhere and say it&#39;s your birthday or anniversary or honeymoon, i don&#39;t expect every restaurant to do something special, but hey, my standards are high when the price tag calls for perfection. Another point: there were definitely gaps between dishes when we had nothing in front of us. We weren&#39;t eating too fast. The couple next to us experienced the same thing. No, not when I am paying for perfection, I don&#39;t expect to wait 10 minutes between courses.2. Food taste: the flavors were all over the place but overall uninteresting and bland.  And they have some sort of obsession with radishes. They might be going for some theme, but there was definitely some pickled radish or sour pickled vegetable on 3 straight dishes. Where&#39;s the variety in flavor and texture?3. Food presentation: this is where it all falls apart to the point of zero stars, to the point of utter disappointment. With the exception of perhaps the first 2 and last courses, the colors were very white and single toned. The presentation was also very boring. Again, standards are higher for a 3 michelin star affair and one always eats with their eyes before their mouths. And i could barely swallow at the appearance of some of the dishes. White on white yells &#34;i don&#39;t care about this dish.&#34;4. Ambiance and decor: average. Overall nice with high ceilings. However, the corner cushioned seats we sat in were dirtied with crumbs. I wonder if the prior patrons had left some crumbs. But again this lack of attention to details is quite upsetting. Who wants to skooch into a seat only to discover your sitting on gritty crumbs??!5. Last note. They come with a wonderful presentation of a baked Alaska for dessert. The torching is on an ~8 inch diameter dessert. They then take it away to prepare the dessert for you...when they return, you get a piece the size of a half-dollar coin. Where&#39;s the rest of my baked Alaska? Also, my husband feels a similar shrinkage in size occurred with the lobster dish, but I thought maybe the crustacean naturally shrinks after cooking...who knows.Seriously, I have never felt that my money went to waste when I&#39;ve dined at a 3 Michelin star restaurant, but here I felt gypped.", "Ratings": 1.0, "Reviewcount": "120", "coolvote": "5", "Usefulvote": "51", "Friendcount": "98", "funnyvote": "24", "No_of_checkin": 0, "No_of_Photos": "33", "Review_length": 623}, {"Review ": "Came here for my boyfriend&#39;s birthday and it was better than I remember (I had come for lunch last time in summer 2013, so was very excited to return for dinner).First of all the service is spectacular. Someone reached out to me about a week before asking if there was anything special the restaurant could do because we were celebrating a birthday. That same person greeted us at the door when we walked in and remembered it was my boyfriend&#39;s birthday.Everyone else was also so attentive, and the attention to detail was incredible. The atmosphere, though elegant was not pretentious and many people (ourself included) were often see chatting away with the staff and laughing with them. Lucy Liu was also dining 2 tables down from us!We had about 4-5 glasses of wine each to pair with our food (we didn&#39;t want to do a full tasting, 8 glasses of wine is just too many), and the sommelier was wonderful and picked great pairings based on our descriptions of what kind of wine we like.On to food:They adapted everything for my boyfriend to be gluten free, from the tarts to the breads to the crumbles, it was very impressive that they were able to make all of his items gluten free.The first thing they bring is the black and white cookie in a box, which was a savory cookie with apple and cheddar; it&#39;s very cheesy and delicious.They then bring an assortment of small bites: parsnip pie, celery root with black truffle, rutabaga with celery and walnuts and salsify with garlic and thyme. My favorite was the celery root and parsnip pie.Then main dishes were the following:Caviar Benedict with smoked sturgeon, diced ham and picked egg yolk. I love caviar (who doesn&#39;t) but don&#39;t love ham flavor and still found it to be awesome.Foie Gras marinated with black truffle and mushroom - holy moly this was delicious. The bread they served with it was croissant like and was perfect. There&#39;s also an option for seared foie gras, but I prefer chilled, maybe will try seated next time if they still have it.Lobster, which was smoked and steamed at the table and then taken back to be plated, with fennel, clam and bouillabaisse. I don&#39;t like licorice flavor, but the fennel was not overpowering.For the vegetable course I chose the Butternut squash, which was roasted with bone marrow and pumpkin seeds and my boyfriend got sweet potato wrapped in bacon with maple syrup glaze. Both were very delicious.For the main dish, there was a choice between duck and oxtail. I chose the duck, which was glazed with honey and lavender with plum and onion. The skin was perfectly crispy and there were subtle Indian flavors on the skin from cumin. I would&#39;ve preferred a sweeter glaze, but the duck was still delicious and cooked perfectly. My boyfriend enjoyed his oxtail but I thought the duck was better.They give you 2 side dishes with the main course: Brussel sprouts roasted with bone marrow and pumpkin seeds, which were amazing and parsnip pure with variations of juniper, also very good.After the main course was a cheese course with bitter greens, which for me was basically a deep fried cheeseball and was delicious. My boyfriend&#39;s version wasn&#39;t deep fried.For dessert we chose the baked Alaska, which was huge and prepared table side. Though tasty it was a bit too sweet and alcohol flavored for me to finish.There&#39;s also the fun game where you match the chocolate bars with the type of milk (cow, buffalo, sheep and goat), I got the sheep and goat right, but switched the cow and buffalo.The chocolate covered pretzel with sea salt was delicious and gluten free!Overall I&#39;m glad I finally returned for dinner.

Imagine the &#34;Now That&#39;s What I Call Music!&#34; CDs and how they highlighted the greatest hits of a certain era. It was akin to that, but only with EMP courses. And much like those CDs, I inflate my expectations that are doomed to never be met.They had some GREAT dishes--the Sea Urchin, Carrot Tartare, and the Milk &amp; Honey (although I should note that no one else shared my sentiment about that last one). The Foie Gras was the SINGLE best foie gras I&#39;ve ever had--even raising a candle to ones I&#39;ve had in Paris. However, I couldn&#39;t help but notice some of the dishes were just so intricately executed, yet they were lacking in flavor. Here at EMP, there&#39;s no such thing as &#34;Less is more.&#34; For example, the roasted suckling pig was just as good as the roast suckling pig that you can get in Chinatown for $7/lb. Also, the gastronomy-inspired Winter in Provence--was plain strange tasting.I will give them credit for their phenomenal service and accommodations, however. One of my dinner companions had a laundry list of allergies. The waiter patiently listened to each and every one, and assured that he too had a wonderful meal that thankfully did not trigger his untimely death. At the end of the meal, they provided parting gifts--a custom print of the menu we had, and a canister of house made granola. (The granola--I learned later, was better than my actual meal).

Since I like to cook, a signed copy of the chefs cookbook was on the table when I arrived. The wait staff intricately explained the menu in detail.I mentioned that I liked to cool. So midway through the meal, they brought us into the kitchen, gave us a full tour, and had the pastry chef prepare a cocktail in front of us. We stood at the standing table and watched the entire process for a few minutes. One of the most amazing things I&#39;ve ever seen!The food...absolutely one of the top five meals of my life...First, they brought an apple cheddar sandwich cookie that looked like a black and white cookie. Amazing!!Then we had the amuse - rutabaga, parsnip, and black truffle celery. Each was unbelievable!Next was one of our favorites - their take on eggs Benedict. Duck egg, hollandaise, and Osetra caviar, served alongside mini English muffins!Then we had their amazing bread. The next course was Foie gras with apples and scallops. All cooked to perfection!Then they steamed a lobster Table side. Followed by bone marrow squash and glazed sweet potato.The entree courses were honey lavender duck and oxtail risotto. Perfectly seasoned and cooked! The side dishes were parsnips and Brussel sprouts.Then their was a truffle cheese course followed by the flaming Baked Alaska for dessert.Finally, they bring four types of chocolate made with goat, bison, cow, and sheep milk.

Expect the unexpected.Beyond excited to return and experience the updated menu and concept, our group of six actually extended the trip one more night to fit this restaurant in. Will travel for food. Clearly. I love my tribe! Welcomed by sommelier Jane Lopes (of the Uncorked reality series following six aspiring master sommeliers as they prepare for the Court of Masters Sommelier exam), dinner started on a fun note. If you haven&#39;t watched the series, get to it! Fan-girl moment aside, Jane happily put up with all of our questions and decanted our wine. Two enthusiastic thumbs up from her for our choice too!We never ordered off a printed menu, unlike my first visit four years ago. The waiter simply asked about allergies and questioned us about our preferences; dinner began shortly afterward. Much like before, dishes were plated with great attention to detail. Most of the time, a fun twist ensued. The unknown is part of the experience.Center stage on the table, a large number of holiday wrapped gifts sat begging for our attention. We had a hunch it would probably be our first course (and not just decor). We were right. Well played, given Christmas was only a couple of weeks away. Designed to complement the caviar -with smoked sturgeon, cream cheese, bagels, and rye crisps-, a selection of small jars filled box after box: beet salad with apple &amp; trout roe, smoked salmon with cucumber &amp; pumpernickel, potato salad with mustard &amp; quail egg, smoked mackerel &amp; salmon with fennel. Boom! Welcome to Eleven Madison Park. Dinner&#39;s only just begun. It took us a while to get through them all, mixing and matching as we went along. I love a place that encourages one to play with food.This year, the Foie Gras, Honey Nut Squash (sage + cinnamon), Lobster (butter poached with rutabaga and pear), and Duck (honey and lavender glazed with turnip and huckleberry) impressed me the most. I happily sat there relishing each second that went by. I never wanted the three-hour-plus dinner to end. I can appreciate (and admire) all it took to birth them all.Served with mixed greens that actually worked very well and in a rare EMP moment, the photogenic &#34;Cheese Course&#34; (really a cheddar tart seamlessly disguised inside of an apple), wowed with its presentation, but disappointed us with its overpowering one-dimensional cheddar taste. Additionally, despite its showy flambing right on the table, I couldn&#39;t enjoy the Baked Alaska. The rum drowned the vanilla and meringue&#39;s sweet and delicate taste, instead of enhancing it. Thankfully, the chocolate &#34;Name the Milk&#34; game ended dinner on a high note. For the record, I failed the test miserably. Pfft. Must. Play. Again. Complimentary St. George Apple Brandy was offered towards the end, but at 40% proof, I couldn&#39;t take more than a couple of sips. Ouch! Kudos to the women next to us who gulped much of it down. Impressive!Once again, I witnessed one of the white cloud-like tablecloths ironed and perfected on the spot. No creases accepted here. That attention to detail is what I know the staff strives for with every table serviced. It&#39;s important to note these highly awarded restaurants keep raising the bar themselves, time after time. I&#39;ve now come to expect the perfection with each visit; it&#39;s part of the marvel and draw.Once finished, we received jars of the famous EMP granola as a keepsake, along with a very carefully designed and curated copy of the night&#39;s menu.Full payment is required in advance.

I would say there were about 12 &#34;courses&#34;- from mushroom appetizers, mini English muffins with eggs Benedict caviar, lobster, venison steak, potatoes with hazelnut spread, chocolate covered pretzels- all served as one surprise after another.

But maybe my observations can help future potential diners, before they plunk down more than a half-grand (for two) on dinner ...First of all, I got our rezzies (6:30p for two on a Saturday in late March), by literally waiting at the computer for the 9 am table release, as if I were buying concert tickets. So there&#39;s that.Our experience began before the date, with an e-mail from EMP, looking to confirm, and personalize, our meal. I responded with a paragraph about our backgrounds (he did ask ...) and why we were dining there (10th wedding anniversary). I got a polite reply e-mail.The information I shared was peppered by our waiter into his conversations with us during our meal. It was a cute touch, but felt a little ... artificial?As we approached, the building, and the room, could not have been more stately. I&#39;m a sucker for limestone, and also for art deco design, so I was gaga. I was not gaga for our greeter, who was warm, effusive, and prone to open-armed gestures as if he were going for a hug. Hey, I&#39;m cool with hugs, but not if that&#39;s not your intent ... the service from everyone over the night was similar. They didn&#39;t take themselves too seriously, but there was more than a hint of ... awkwardness? It could very well be that *I* was the awkward, nervous one, and they were trying to deal with me. Entirely possible. Almost ... likely ...As for the rest of the design elements, nothing was left to chance. Even the banquettes had pillows between the diners, as a kind of visual break. Nice touch. Some two-tops were sat across from each other, some, side-by-side. It was clear that that this was for traffic flow, but side-by-side eating can be awkward for some ...The final design element I wanted to mention was the working rotary phone near the bathrooms. It&#39;s old-school and awesome, and I loved it.I got the wine pairing - I appreciated the thought that went into the selections, especially for going local with New York wines (I loved the Empire Estate dry riesling).So, the food. Portion size was an issue on some things, like the lobster, and the flambed Alaska (where the heck did the rest of it go?). But generally, the food was impeccable, and in some cases, transformative. The duck - after the duck at EMP, I don&#39;t remember eating any duck before it, nor do I think I can ever eat duck ever again. It will never even approach what EMP served me. The same for the foie gras, and the parsnips, surprisingly. Those parsnips blew me away.Wife had a similar experience. She loves mushrooms, and they redefined mushrooms for her.The &#34;New York&#34; touches were cute - the &#34;black and white&#34; savory cookie to start, and the &#34;eggs benedict&#34; caviar (though I wanted to taste more of the caviar - if I&#39;m eating caviar, I want to know it).I really appreciated the final course, the &#34;name that milk&#34; game, where different chocolates were made (by Mast) with different animal milks. Though I failed that game, I definitely picked out the funky, grassy, or mild notes in the chocolate. Fun and also educational.The reason I can remember the meal so well is because they print up personalized menus at the end of the meal! God, how long have I wanted this. A record of what I ate! So impressive.As impressive as waiting at the door with your coat without having a coat check ticket. The only way they can pull that off is by paying close attention, which was a recurring theme through the night.Finally, the parting gift - the container of granola! I snacked on it all week, that stuff was crack.Eleven Madison Park gave us the best meal of our lives (sorry, Gramercy Tavern).

While it&#39;s slightly standard fixtures make you wonder if this is just a normal fine dining establish, once you embark on this culinary journey, you will see that this is anything but ordinary.The food is excellent. It is obvious that care and immense thought is put into every dish. If you have allergies or dietary restrictions, you will be taken care of with superb alternatives.

It is a tasting menu but you have a variety of choices as you go.But the story line that is crafted alongside thisdish.esis what really makes EMP an absolute must for any food lover. It&#39;s a season story that pairs well with each dish. During our summer menu, we went on a picnic (with all the proper accessories) and watched fruit be grilled in tiny barbecues. We played games with season chocolates decorated with the leaves fund in nearby Madison Square Park.

It&#39;s from the 90s. All the residents from some town are in this black and white world and everyone thinks that the black and white life is fine and dandy. Then some random guy gets puked on by a rainbow and brings color to the world and the townsfolk realize what they&#39;ve been missing all along. Not familiar? Admittedly, I&#39;ve never seen the movie; so the above plot summary is entirely fabricated. However, my experience at EMP is what I imagine those poor schmucks in Pleasantville experienced when they finally looked up at the world and saw things in vivid vibrant color. I thought I knew what eating good food was like, and then I had EMP.I&#39;m a pretty seasoned eater. I celebrate chefs like normal people celebrate Beyonce. I hope someday to leave a bloated happy corpse full of foie gras and butter. I&#39;ve had Michelin starred restaurants around the world and this place blew them all out of the water.The decor is tasteful and inviting but not pretentious. Fluffy pillows on benches, cozy nooks, beautiful linens, and amazing flower arrangements greet you as you walk in. The lighting is warm and welcoming as the ambiance strikes that perfect balance between casual and upscale.The service is everything you&#39;d expect from the no. 3 restaurant in the world: fast, attentive, gracious, and friendly. Our server was incredibly kind and put up with our selfies, questions, requests for information and clarification, and even shared some personal anecdotes -- which made the setting feel even more relaxed. The sommelier hit it out of the park when my friend asked for a &#34;funky strong fruity wine like they have in South Africa.&#34; A gorgeous Australian(?) chef came out and prepared a dish tableside (I almost tried to marry him as he was plating my lobster). The human element at EMP was a perfectly balanced whirling dervish of style, panache, and hospitality.Now to the food. God the food. Chef Humm really knows how to work his flavors. Less restrained than a more traditional fine dining establishment like Le Bernadin, EMP throws out bold combinations of flavors and textures, beautiful tableside presentations, and a sense of creatively with the dishes that makes you feel like the kitchen would be a really fun place to work.We opened with a gorgeous black and white savory cookie. Hints of apple and cheddar with a rich, flaky, crumbly texture. Delicious and the perfect way to start the meal off.Next, the sexy Australian chef comes out with a multi tiered rack of small appetizers. All vegetable based and presented beautifully; each bite was a celebration of the distinct flavors of its star vegetable.There are several amazing courses which I have to skip over b/c of character limits on these reviews (The sexy chef is nowhere to be found during these courses. I assume it&#39;s because he is planning our courtship). They are all very, very good. Trust me.My favorite dish of the night is EMPs take on Eggs Benedict. Small tins of egg yolk, ham and caviar are served alongside a quartet of adorable tiny biscuits. I could eat a wheelbarrow full of this stuff. The egg yolk and caviar is rich and unctuous with smoky ham flavor; and the biscuits are light and fluffy with just enough crunch on the crust so that you have that element of textural interest in the mouthfeel.Later in the meal, Sexy Chef returns with a large broiler pan filled with lobsters, clams, fennel, seaweed, and FIRE (the showmanship!).  I lose myself in my husband to be&#39;s eyes (and accent) as he pours a flask of fragrant white wine into the pan; and I&#39;m swept away in the aromatics of the fennel and the wine as a cloud of steam wafts up. My future husband then takes the broiler away. We almost have our first fight. He soon brings the lobster back on a plate and we make up. The lobster is served with an amazingly complex and delicate Uni mayonnaise and some kind of sauce made up of lobster juice and magic.One last highlight was from another &#34;choose your own adventure&#34; course. A choice btw a sweet potato with apple or butternut squash and bone marrow. I pick squash and my outraged companion chastises me for being from Texas and rejecting a sweet potato when there&#39;s one offered. I do not regret my choice. The smokey richness and umami of the bone marrow plays perfectly with the sweetness of the squash. Her sweet potato is perfectly cooked with a crispy outer skin and a beautifully pillowy interior. My companion eats large bites of my squash and I try not to stab her hand with my fork.As the evening progresses, there are more courses, amazing tea, decadent cheeses, and a very high stakes chocolate game at the end; all of which must be omitted for brevity&#39;s sake. If I were so allowed, this review would go on for ages, but it&#39;s likely most of you have already stopped reading. In closing, start saving your pennies and find the time to come here.

That was me.My review is probably harsh and nitpicky but I can list other restaurants that have outdone EMP in different areas.4 star service - wait staffs were attentive but they fell short personalization and synchronization.A)  Personalization - before arriving, EMP contacts you to see if it&#39;s a special occasion, if you have any food allergies or dietary restrictions. We went there for our anniversary and not that I am looking for complimentary toast or dessert but no one mentioned or congratulated us on our anniversary. That was a minor miss. The bigger misses were in the beginning. The wait staff asked again if we had any food allergies or food aversion. We said no. But the survey was already taken the day before so it would be nice for the staff to reconfirm our answer rather than re-asking the same question we already answered.B)  Synchronization - this is an observation on the party of 6 table in front of us where plates were not served in sync. It was a table of 3 ladies and 3 gentlemen with 3 wait staff serving. The plates came out the same time but placing it on the table was off and at one point a gentleman was served first before the plate was served to the lady (Big Gasp right?!?). This SUPER nitpicky but I always remember how well Del Posto executed their plate-serving synchronization when we went as a group of 5.3 star food/menu - there were no physical menus presented but the server spoke about the options. I personally appreciate visually seeing what&#39;s on the menu and the components in the dish so I can be more engaged with my dishes incase I have questions on the ingredients. The food itself was good but it was nothing mind blowing except for the caviar dish for me. That was amazing! The food in general was good but not memorable. It was bland and maybe it&#39;s the menu served that day but it&#39;s missing complexity. That especially goes for the lobster dish which is essentially the tail plus some bisque which by the way my husband had a piece of shell on his dish. The presentation was lacking. Same plates were used throughout the meal and nothing creative with plating. Our wine pairing glasses had more character than the plates. Per Se definitely takes the cake in everything but especially in presentation. One negative note on the food is the duck. I&#39;m a huge duck fan and whenever that&#39;s an option on the menu, that would be my go to. I felt mine was overcooked and had to send it back for a more medium/pink center one. The replacement one came and it was still over cooked to the point where it was super hard for me to cut with the smooth edge knife they served it with. I felt a serrated knife would be a more proper utensil pairing but they did not have any in the restaurant.4 star cocktail drinks - drinks were good and good presentation but of course it doesn&#39;t compare drinks at Flatiron Room, Raines Law Room, etc.3 star ambiance/dcor - the space is big and open with very high ceilings with a modern look but it&#39;s not warm, engaging or stimulating. For a good ambiance dcor restaurant, Daniel would be the top contender for me.", "Ratings": 3.0, "Reviewcount": "138", "coolvote": "", "Usefulvote": "", "Friendcount": "15", "funnyvote": "", "No_of_checkin": 0, "No_of_Photos": "24", "Review_length": 579}, {"Review ": "I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m giving &#34;The Best Restaurant in the World&#34; a 4 star rating. Completely missing the WOW factor you expect as far as food is concerned. And I&#39;m usually extremely generous with 5 star ratings. But if you&#39;re going to be #1 you have to really be #1. Honestly the ambiance, service, and attention to detail is top top. It&#39;s why they&#39;re rated what they are. But the food was only good! It&#39;s so disappointing! I expected flavors, dishes I&#39;d wish I could try again but wouldn&#39;t be able to until I somehow came back here. Not 1. If it wasn&#39;t for the service I&#39;d say my rating would be a 3, maybe even a 2 because of price. I think the missing factor was that the food was bland. In fact the newly renovated venue was pretty bland and underwhelming as well.Now for the positives! Did a tour of the kitchen, it&#39;s totally calm and huge and clean and beautiful. Real masterpiece back there since the renovations. There&#39;s a real relaxing vibe to the place, that was great. You also get about 10 different servers come to you throughout the night, felt like we were hosted by the whole kitchen - staff really cares about what they do and take it super seriously. That was nice. I think they also do a great job of accommodating. If I had an allergy, or didn&#39;t like a certain type of food, you get the impression they&#39;ll drive over to McDonald&#39;s to get you a burger if that&#39;s what they think you really want and to accommodate you. Unfortunately I eat everything and I&#39;m not a picky difficult person so I couldn&#39;t benefit personally from that level of accommodation they definitely excel at.Bottom line: they need to rethink their tasting menu because if you&#39;re #1, you can&#39;t have ok dishes.

Despite everything being good, there was only 1 dish that I thought was truly amazing flavor-wise. And that was their mushroom dish. Everything else was extremely visually appealing and the whole experience was wonderful, but as a true foodie it is tough for me to give them a perfect 5.The way in which each dish is presented definitely gave me moments of awe as I sat there mesmerized at the presentation and manipulation of common ingredients brought about in different ways.Note: Everything was good but only 1 was greatAs for the service and experience it is definitely 5 stars for me. At the end of the meal, they give you your personalized tasting menu written in the order of presentation alongside some oats for breakfast the next day. One of the things that gave me such an added boost is that there is no dress code!!! Yes no dress code!! Just be comfortable!Overall, I highly recommend anyone who is willing to spend a little, to give this place a try as the experience is dazzling, the servers are friendly, and they make you feel like victorian age nobility.

We had been following the remodel of EMP and were really looking forward to our meal. We left very satiated with no regrets.The ultimate takeaway of our experience was that for the cost, it was worth it, but only for a nice occasion. Would I necessarily be able to justify the high cost for just an average night - absolutely not. And for the high cost, was everything done impeccably? Close, but not quite. I&#39;ve had equally great food at a lower price point (eg, $150 pp vs $300 pp), but where EMP really sets itself above the rest is service. There was never a moment that we felt forgotten about. Napkins were folded, surfaces cleaned, shawls were delivered (for us perpetually shivering ladies!), and tablecloths were ironed (literally!). In terms of the food, at that cost and at 3 Michelin stars, I really expected to be WOW&#39;d by every single dish. Unfortunately, this was just not the case.STANDOUTS:- Starter bites: compressed apples dipped in foie gras caramel with apple almond crumble. Who would have known that tart apple and the sweetness of the caramel could be so well complimented by smooth and rich foie gras?!- Smoked sturgeon cheesecake with caviar: this one was communally served and an absolute showstopper! it tasted like an ultra luxurious bagel with lox and looked a million bucks. Could have taken it without the pickled cucumbers.- Seared warm foie gras dish with beets: This course was presented with various other options (clams with fennel, mushroom carpaccio, or the cold foie gras preparation with cabbage). I ended up choosing the clams, but this to me was the CLEAR winner. I would try to explain all the components of the dish, but frankly I am not sure (aside from the beets, there was a crunch component), and it was just indescribable. This is hands down one of the best things I&#39;ve ever tasted!- Roasted duck with honey and lavender: beautiful and impeccably executed from head to toe. The duck with succulent and juicy and the crusted skin with salt and honey provided just the right amount of texture to the dish.COULD HAVE DONE WITHOUT:- Starter bites: sweet potato tart. They compared it to a sweet potato pie when describing to us, but honestly it was a very sad, black sheep version. I feel like there are so many better things that can be done with a sweet potato.- Clams with fennel: while visually beautiful and labor intensive, I just found the taste to be one note: surfer clams, with clam mouse, and dill. It felt like it was missing something and it was not the most pleasing texture.- Kale seasonal side with egg yolk: There was something underneath the kale (perhaps a kale puree) that was a very deep green color with a bitter taste and displeasing texture. Honestly, I wasn&#39;t sure what it was and it was the only thing we ate all night that was left on the plate.- Wine pairings: Unfortunately, we were not impressed by a majority of the pairings chosen and would probably do without this the next time around.For the experience as a whole (food, service, kitchen tour), we had a great night. But for the overall bill, it just felt like there were certain areas that could have been improved. For $300 a person, I think the kabocha squash course and cheddar with pretzel and beer could be improved/elevated (lovely, just not something I would expect at this pricepoint). However, the personalization and take home gifts were certainly nice touches and I would absolutely recommend EMP to everyone looking to have a nice night out.", "Ratings": 4.0, "Reviewcount": "190", "coolvote": "", "Usefulvote": "2", "Friendcount": "169", "funnyvote": "", "No_of_checkin": 0, "No_of_Photos": "814", "Review_length": 628}, {"Review ": "Excellent. 10/10 I loved everything about my experience here.

The service is great off the bat. Everyone is so friendly and wanting to make your dining experience memorable. The overall atmosphere was casual and not as stuck up as I thought it would be.With the tasting menu, we tried a variety of dishes. The most memorable for me was the celery root being cooked inside an animal&#39;s stomach I believe, and they do this at your table. Another great dish was their oysters which was served two ways on one plate: savory and sweet. So delectable. My favorite though was the lobster dish. Bursting with flavor and perfectly cooked. I liked their savory dishes more than the sweet. As we go through each dish, I notice their flavors are more traditional. I tasted a lot of maple syrup and apple flavors in multiple courses, but the presentation is always creative and out of the box.As a final treat after all that good food, they also gave us some homemade granola to go as a nice parting gift.

Well, I stand corrected, EMP has definitely earned its title as best restaurant in the world (per 2017&#39;s San Pellegrino&#39;s list). For those of you that like me, may have been living under a rock these last several years, EMP offers an 11-course tasting menu (estimated to take about 3.5 hours to get through) and a policy of asking for payment when the reservation is booked (leaving you to only pay for your drinks on the night of the reservation). Since EMP is slated to close this summer in order to undergo huge kitchen and dining room reservations, the menu they are currently offering is their greatest hits dishes from over the year.Every dish was amazing. From the simpler (in presentation anyway) dishes such as gougeres with grated gruyere to grinding up carrots tableside for their carrot tartare dish or serving a turbot with zucchini scales, everything was phenomenal. My personal favority was a foie gras torchon which maple syrup on the inside.The service was top notch as well. I asked for one of the hostess&#39;s where the ladies room and waited for her to give the regular &#34;turn right/left and walk down the corridor...&#34; instructions. But not at EMP. Here I was escorted all the way to the door of the ladies room.The pacing of the meal was excellent as well. Since it was just two of us for dinner and we didn&#39;t end up drinking, we finished up after about 2.5 hours. However, it seemed that we were not the norm as we finished far in advance of the other tables that were leisurely enjoying their wine pairing, etc.My favorite part of the meal had to be our interaction with the general manager(?) at the end. We ordered tableside tea (more curious about what that entailed than anything else) and were treated with a wonderful presentation where he discussed and demonstrated a one versus three-steeping process and answered our questions about the restaurant renovations and what would happen to the staff (they are opening a pop-up restaurant over the summer in the Hampton&#39;s and a major driver of that decision was to provide employment to their best asset... their people).Lastly, they finished off the meal with offering us a complementary glass of brandy for my husband and sparkling (non-alcoholic) cider for me. I was very impressed with how well they were paying attention. My husband had ordered 1-drink at the bar while (due to a crappy cold) I ordered two non-alcoholic drinks and mostly drank water at the table. The waitstaff, with everything else going on, was able to notice that my husband would be inclined to drink the brandy, while correctly surmising that I would need to go the non-alcoholic route.The final impressive touch came with our parting gift. Most of the high-end restaurants are now in the habit of providing an extra food treat to take home and EMP was no exception, except that instead of a tiny tin of cookies or chocolate, we received two large glass canisters of granola.", "Ratings": 5.0, "Reviewcount": "47", "coolvote": "7", "Usefulvote": "13", "Friendcount": "73", "funnyvote": "4", "No_of_checkin": "", "No_of_Photos": "159", "Review_length": 531}, {"Review ": "I had been several years ago and was a bit underwhelmed but decided to make a reservation in the bar for dinner since it reopened.

Unfortunately, here is my honest review of the place.Before I even go into the details, let me start by saying this is indeed an amazing restaurant. But if it is deemed the best of the best, then I will hold it by those standards. It did fall short of those expectations and as such, I&#39;m giving it a 3 star rating. It may be harsh, but you&#39;re spending a significant amount for an incredible experience so you have to be better than just better than the next guy.Pros:- Even before you get to the restaurant, someone personally reaches out to you to make sure everything is perfect. It&#39;s a great personal touch.- There were some great dishes, the lobster bisque sauce was perfect. The pretzel was amazing. I also really enjoyed the veal.- The staff is very friendly and mostly attentive.- The kitchen tour was a nice touch, especially to show off the new set upCons:- The dinner is too long. I believe it was purposely done as to not make you feel rushed but the courses had 30 minute gaps in some places. We had a 6:15 start and didn&#39;t finish until around 10:20.- The dishes were good but not amazing. I can&#39;t honestly say any one dish blew me away.- At one point, one of the servers spilled my wine glass on me. Now this wasn&#39;t a big deal on its own, as mistakes happen. It was more of how it was handled that was a bit upsetting for a restaurant of this caliber. So after she spilled the wine on my jacket, she picked up the glass and placed it back on my table. She apologized and handed me a towel. Another member of the waitstaff also came over to help clean up and hand me additional towels. All great until I look up and see my empty and sticky wine glass sitting on the table. I&#39;m not expecting a freebie but I&#39;ve been to much lesser restaurants where they would come back with a new glass at least. At the end, I had to ask for a new one myself. Normally not a huge deal, but if you&#39;re the best restaurant in the world...Overall, EMP is a great dining establishment and anyone would be lucky to go.

Having dined at many other high-end restaurants I was excited, but also nervous, about not wanting to be let down with lofty expectations. However, from the moment we stepped into EMP, our magical evening began on a great foot by the immaculate decor and the impeccable service.We opted for a 5 course vegetarian tasting menu with wine pairings for our Valentine&#39;s Day meal. My husband had surprised me with an all-Riesling wine pairing (my favorite wine), which was an added bonus! Some of the Rieslings that were part of this pairing ranged from $150/bottle-over $400/bottle, so you can imagine how delicious and wonderfully paired our meal was. Onto the food, which was quite possibly, the most flavorful meal I&#39;ve ever had. What I enjoyed most about the vegetarian tasting menu was that the food may have looked somewhat simple at first glance, but once you took a bite of food, you quickly realized how much complexity and depth of flavors and textures was hidden in every bite. I absolutely loved the cauliflower play on caviar, the sweet potato with jus, the kohlrabi salad, and the mushroom risotto!There were also small touches that made the experience extremely personalized and distinguished it from other high-end restaurants, such as, the private tour of the kitchen, complete with a cocktail, the sea salt pretzel and cocktail at the end of the meal, and the granola parting gift (best granola ever!!).My husband and I have already decided we are going to be back for the 10-12 course pairing menu the next time we&#39;re in NYC!", "Ratings": 5.0, "Reviewcount": "94", "coolvote": "", "Usefulvote": "1", "Friendcount": "25", "funnyvote": "", "No_of_checkin": 0, "No_of_Photos": "24", "Review_length": 299}, {"Review ": "I don&#39;t typically leave reviews for places outside of my yelp territory but this place definitely deserves the praise.I&#39;ve read about Eleven Madison Park for years, saw it kept its 3 Michelin stars AND made #3 best restaurant in the WORLD this year. So my expectations were high to start with and they did not let down. We planned our next foodie trip from Seattle to New York and made dinner reservations months in advance.As soon as we arrived, service was everything you&#39;d think it would be.. everyone was attentive, knowledgeable, personable; they just seemed like they enjoyed being there and were really passionate about the industry they are in. About 20 different people served our table throughout the night. One gentleman really knew his scotch and my boyfriend was very impressed with that!The food, I&#39;ve read mixed reviews about it but for me.. everything was amazing! Lots of intense flavors, mixed textures, supple meats, and overall just a personalized and truly unique dining experience! My favorite part, I had requested a kitchen tour while the maitre d was out of office and wasn&#39;t sure if we&#39;d get to see it. But towards the end of our dinner a man dressed in a suit walks up to the table, bends down closer to us and asks, &#34;are you ready to see the kitchen?&#34; And my hearts starts pounding! It was so exciting to go back there and see where the magic happens! He gave us a mini tour and had another kind lady fix us up a wonderful cocktail! Honestly, the experience was dream-like and was really the cherry on top of my trip and really pushed me to leave a glowing review!I can&#39;t elaborate enough how much I enjoyed our dinner service at EMP.

Before I get to it I should start from the beginning. Made online reservations and came here on a weekday around 9pm. Pre-paid- no tip required. You can buy drinks (DELICIOUS). Did the bar tasting which means it was 2-3hours vs. the table which is 5 hours. The bar tasting had 5 courses which was sufficient enough for me.Service was obviously impeccable and lovely ambiance. You get to choose between certain courses. I picked the duck over the oxtail (good choice on my part). I honestly had an amazing thing here. My favorite dish was the caviar- SERIOUSLY WHAT IS IN HERE?!?!?! I WOULD BUY TONS OF IT (if I didn&#39;t become homeless afterwards). I think it is around 70 bucks regularly if you order a la carte. BUT REALLY WHAT IS IN THERE. HEAVEN IN MY MOUTH. Real talk.The other dishes weren&#39;t that memorable- duck was great- not so sure about the skin but it cooked perfectly! I liked that they gave you a granola jar to take home (Um...DELICIOUS granola just FYI- u want to eat that asap).Came here for the experience and I think it&#39;s worth it (at least once).

But that said, I have dined at almost ten 3 michelin starred restaurants and several 2 and 1 starred restaurants...and this one barely deserves 1 star when compared to my experiences. There are plenty of other 3-starred restaurants in NYC that are far superior than this one. So for a price tag of about $400/pp (after taxes and beverages), go elsewhere. If you dont want to read the whole review, let me illustrate it in a few senctences. My husband is a huge lover of cheese and he was starving by the time we arrived for dinner. Near the end, there was a cheese course. Not only did I think it was gross, but my hungry cheese-loving husband couldn&#39;t even finish it. And no, the waiters did not ask if there was something wrong nor was a replacement offered.Now, let me break this down:1. Service: pretty standard 3 michelin quality service. Attentive and meticulous. But do they go above of and beyond? No. We came a week after our wedding and they were aware of this. We had just finished a trip to Napa and perhaps we had been spoiled, but nearly every place we went, they somehow acknowledged this point with a complimentary toast or small dessert or even a congratulatory note in the end. Now if you go somewhere and say it&#39;s your birthday or anniversary or honeymoon, i don&#39;t expect every restaurant to do something special, but hey, my standards are high when the price tag calls for perfection. Another point: there were definitely gaps between dishes when we had nothing in front of us. We weren&#39;t eating too fast. The couple next to us experienced the same thing. No, not when I am paying for perfection, I don&#39;t expect to wait 10 minutes between courses.2. Food taste: the flavors were all over the place but overall uninteresting and bland.  And they have some sort of obsession with radishes. They might be going for some theme, but there was definitely some pickled radish or sour pickled vegetable on 3 straight dishes. Where&#39;s the variety in flavor and texture?3. Food presentation: this is where it all falls apart to the point of zero stars, to the point of utter disappointment. With the exception of perhaps the first 2 and last courses, the colors were very white and single toned. The presentation was also very boring. Again, standards are higher for a 3 michelin star affair and one always eats with their eyes before their mouths. And i could barely swallow at the appearance of some of the dishes. White on white yells &#34;i don&#39;t care about this dish.&#34;4. Ambiance and decor: average. Overall nice with high ceilings. However, the corner cushioned seats we sat in were dirtied with crumbs. I wonder if the prior patrons had left some crumbs. But again this lack of attention to details is quite upsetting. Who wants to skooch into a seat only to discover your sitting on gritty crumbs??!5. Last note. They come with a wonderful presentation of a baked Alaska for dessert. The torching is on an ~8 inch diameter dessert. They then take it away to prepare the dessert for you...when they return, you get a piece the size of a half-dollar coin. Where&#39;s the rest of my baked Alaska? Also, my husband feels a similar shrinkage in size occurred with the lobster dish, but I thought maybe the crustacean naturally shrinks after cooking...who knows.Seriously, I have never felt that my money went to waste when I&#39;ve dined at a 3 Michelin star restaurant, but here I felt gypped.", "Ratings": 1.0, "Reviewcount": "120", "coolvote": "5", "Usefulvote": "51", "Friendcount": "98", "funnyvote": "24", "No_of_checkin": 0, "No_of_Photos": "33", "Review_length": 623}, {"Review ": "Came here for my boyfriend&#39;s birthday and it was better than I remember (I had come for lunch last time in summer 2013, so was very excited to return for dinner).First of all the service is spectacular. Someone reached out to me about a week before asking if there was anything special the restaurant could do because we were celebrating a birthday. That same person greeted us at the door when we walked in and remembered it was my boyfriend&#39;s birthday.Everyone else was also so attentive, and the attention to detail was incredible. The atmosphere, though elegant was not pretentious and many people (ourself included) were often see chatting away with the staff and laughing with them. Lucy Liu was also dining 2 tables down from us!We had about 4-5 glasses of wine each to pair with our food (we didn&#39;t want to do a full tasting, 8 glasses of wine is just too many), and the sommelier was wonderful and picked great pairings based on our descriptions of what kind of wine we like.On to food:They adapted everything for my boyfriend to be gluten free, from the tarts to the breads to the crumbles, it was very impressive that they were able to make all of his items gluten free.The first thing they bring is the black and white cookie in a box, which was a savory cookie with apple and cheddar; it&#39;s very cheesy and delicious.They then bring an assortment of small bites: parsnip pie, celery root with black truffle, rutabaga with celery and walnuts and salsify with garlic and thyme. My favorite was the celery root and parsnip pie.Then main dishes were the following:Caviar Benedict with smoked sturgeon, diced ham and picked egg yolk. I love caviar (who doesn&#39;t) but don&#39;t love ham flavor and still found it to be awesome.Foie Gras marinated with black truffle and mushroom - holy moly this was delicious. The bread they served with it was croissant like and was perfect. There&#39;s also an option for seared foie gras, but I prefer chilled, maybe will try seated next time if they still have it.Lobster, which was smoked and steamed at the table and then taken back to be plated, with fennel, clam and bouillabaisse. I don&#39;t like licorice flavor, but the fennel was not overpowering.For the vegetable course I chose the Butternut squash, which was roasted with bone marrow and pumpkin seeds and my boyfriend got sweet potato wrapped in bacon with maple syrup glaze. Both were very delicious.For the main dish, there was a choice between duck and oxtail. I chose the duck, which was glazed with honey and lavender with plum and onion. The skin was perfectly crispy and there were subtle Indian flavors on the skin from cumin. I would&#39;ve preferred a sweeter glaze, but the duck was still delicious and cooked perfectly. My boyfriend enjoyed his oxtail but I thought the duck was better.They give you 2 side dishes with the main course: Brussel sprouts roasted with bone marrow and pumpkin seeds, which were amazing and parsnip pure with variations of juniper, also very good.After the main course was a cheese course with bitter greens, which for me was basically a deep fried cheeseball and was delicious. My boyfriend&#39;s version wasn&#39;t deep fried.For dessert we chose the baked Alaska, which was huge and prepared table side. Though tasty it was a bit too sweet and alcohol flavored for me to finish.There&#39;s also the fun game where you match the chocolate bars with the type of milk (cow, buffalo, sheep and goat), I got the sheep and goat right, but switched the cow and buffalo.The chocolate covered pretzel with sea salt was delicious and gluten free!Overall I&#39;m glad I finally returned for dinner.

Imagine the &#34;Now That&#39;s What I Call Music!&#34; CDs and how they highlighted the greatest hits of a certain era. It was akin to that, but only with EMP courses. And much like those CDs, I inflate my expectations that are doomed to never be met.They had some GREAT dishes--the Sea Urchin, Carrot Tartare, and the Milk &amp; Honey (although I should note that no one else shared my sentiment about that last one). The Foie Gras was the SINGLE best foie gras I&#39;ve ever had--even raising a candle to ones I&#39;ve had in Paris. However, I couldn&#39;t help but notice some of the dishes were just so intricately executed, yet they were lacking in flavor. Here at EMP, there&#39;s no such thing as &#34;Less is more.&#34; For example, the roasted suckling pig was just as good as the roast suckling pig that you can get in Chinatown for $7/lb. Also, the gastronomy-inspired Winter in Provence--was plain strange tasting.I will give them credit for their phenomenal service and accommodations, however. One of my dinner companions had a laundry list of allergies. The waiter patiently listened to each and every one, and assured that he too had a wonderful meal that thankfully did not trigger his untimely death. At the end of the meal, they provided parting gifts--a custom print of the menu we had, and a canister of house made granola. (The granola--I learned later, was better than my actual meal).

Duck egg, hollandaise, and Osetra caviar, served alongside mini English muffins!Then we had their amazing bread. The next course was Foie gras with apples and scallops.

Clearly. I love my tribe! Welcomed by sommelier Jane Lopes (of the Uncorked reality series following six aspiring master sommeliers as they prepare for the Court of Masters Sommelier exam), dinner started on a fun note. If you haven&#39;t watched the series, get to it! Fan-girl moment aside, Jane happily put up with all of our questions and decanted our wine. Two enthusiastic thumbs up from her for our choice too!We never ordered off a printed menu, unlike my first visit four years ago. The waiter simply asked about allergies and questioned us about our preferences; dinner began shortly afterward. Much like before, dishes were plated with great attention to detail. Most of the time, a fun twist ensued. The unknown is part of the experience.Center stage on the table, a large number of holiday wrapped gifts sat begging for our attention. We had a hunch it would probably be our first course (and not just decor). We were right. Well played, given Christmas was only a couple of weeks away. Designed to complement the caviar -with smoked sturgeon, cream cheese, bagels, and rye crisps-, a selection of small jars filled box after box: beet salad with apple &amp; trout roe, smoked salmon with cucumber &amp; pumpernickel, potato salad with mustard &amp; quail egg, smoked mackerel &amp; salmon with fennel. Boom! Welcome to Eleven Madison Park. Dinner&#39;s only just begun. It took us a while to get through them all, mixing and matching as we went along. I love a place that encourages one to play with food.This year, the Foie Gras, Honey Nut Squash (sage + cinnamon), Lobster (butter poached with rutabaga and pear), and Duck (honey and lavender glazed with turnip and huckleberry) impressed me the most. I happily sat there relishing each second that went by. I never wanted the three-hour-plus dinner to end. I can appreciate (and admire) all it took to birth them all.Served with mixed greens that actually worked very well and in a rare EMP moment, the photogenic &#34;Cheese Course&#34; (really a cheddar tart seamlessly disguised inside of an apple), wowed with its presentation, but disappointed us with its overpowering one-dimensional cheddar taste. Additionally, despite its showy flambing right on the table, I couldn&#39;t enjoy the Baked Alaska. The rum drowned the vanilla and meringue&#39;s sweet and delicate taste, instead of enhancing it. Thankfully, the chocolate &#34;Name the Milk&#34; game ended dinner on a high note. For the record, I failed the test miserably. Pfft. Must. Play. Again. Complimentary St. George Apple Brandy was offered towards the end, but at 40% proof, I couldn&#39;t take more than a couple of sips. Ouch! Kudos to the women next to us who gulped much of it down. Impressive!Once again, I witnessed one of the white cloud-like tablecloths ironed and perfected on the spot. No creases accepted here. That attention to detail is what I know the staff strives for with every table serviced. It&#39;s important to note these highly awarded restaurants keep raising the bar themselves, time after time.

Maybe, 95%.Now of course, on a five-star scale, EMP can&#39;t earn anything less than five stars. C&#39;mon, now, it&#39;s #3 on the World&#39;s 50 Best list (EDIT: Yeah, it&#39;s #1 now). But maybe my observations can help future potential diners, before they plunk down more than a half-grand (for two) on dinner ...First of all, I got our rezzies (6:30p for two on a Saturday in late March), by literally waiting at the computer for the 9 am table release, as if I were buying concert tickets. So there&#39;s that.Our experience began before the date, with an e-mail from EMP, looking to confirm, and personalize, our meal. I responded with a paragraph about our backgrounds (he did ask ...) and why we were dining there (10th wedding anniversary). I got a polite reply e-mail.The information I shared was peppered by our waiter into his conversations with us during our meal. It was a cute touch, but felt a little ... artificial?As we approached, the building, and the room, could not have been more stately. I&#39;m a sucker for limestone, and also for art deco design, so I was gaga. I was not gaga for our greeter, who was warm, effusive, and prone to open-armed gestures as if he were going for a hug. Hey, I&#39;m cool with hugs, but not if that&#39;s not your intent ... the service from everyone over the night was similar. They didn&#39;t take themselves too seriously, but there was more than a hint of ... awkwardness? It could very well be that *I* was the awkward, nervous one, and they were trying to deal with me. Entirely possible. Almost ... likely ...As for the rest of the design elements, nothing was left to chance. Even the banquettes had pillows between the diners, as a kind of visual break. Nice touch. Some two-tops were sat across from each other, some, side-by-side. It was clear that that this was for traffic flow, but side-by-side eating can be awkward for some ...The final design element I wanted to mention was the working rotary phone near the bathrooms. It&#39;s old-school and awesome, and I loved it.I got the wine pairing - I appreciated the thought that went into the selections, especially for going local with New York wines (I loved the Empire Estate dry riesling).So, the food. Portion size was an issue on some things, like the lobster, and the flambed Alaska (where the heck did the rest of it go?). But generally, the food was impeccable, and in some cases, transformative. The duck - after the duck at EMP, I don&#39;t remember eating any duck before it, nor do I think I can ever eat duck ever again. It will never even approach what EMP served me. The same for the foie gras, and the parsnips, surprisingly. Those parsnips blew me away.Wife had a similar experience. She loves mushrooms, and they redefined mushrooms for her.The &#34;New York&#34; touches were cute - the &#34;black and white&#34; savory cookie to start, and the &#34;eggs benedict&#34; caviar (though I wanted to taste more of the caviar - if I&#39;m eating caviar, I want to know it).I really appreciated the final course, the &#34;name that milk&#34; game, where different chocolates were made (by Mast) with different animal milks. Though I failed that game, I definitely picked out the funky, grassy, or mild notes in the chocolate. Fun and also educational.The reason I can remember the meal so well is because they print up personalized menus at the end of the meal! God, how long have I wanted this. A record of what I ate! So impressive.As impressive as waiting at the door with your coat without having a coat check ticket. The only way they can pull that off is by paying close attention, which was a recurring theme through the night.Finally, the parting gift - the container of granola! I snacked on it all week, that stuff was crack.Eleven Madison Park gave us the best meal of our lives (sorry, Gramercy Tavern).

It&#39;s from the 90s. All the residents from some town are in this black and white world and everyone thinks that the black and white life is fine and dandy. Then some random guy gets puked on by a rainbow and brings color to the world and the townsfolk realize what they&#39;ve been missing all along. Not familiar? Admittedly, I&#39;ve never seen the movie; so the above plot summary is entirely fabricated. However, my experience at EMP is what I imagine those poor schmucks in Pleasantville experienced when they finally looked up at the world and saw things in vivid vibrant color. I thought I knew what eating good food was like, and then I had EMP.I&#39;m a pretty seasoned eater. I celebrate chefs like normal people celebrate Beyonce. I hope someday to leave a bloated happy corpse full of foie gras and butter. I&#39;ve had Michelin starred restaurants around the world and this place blew them all out of the water.The decor is tasteful and inviting but not pretentious. Fluffy pillows on benches, cozy nooks, beautiful linens, and amazing flower arrangements greet you as you walk in. The lighting is warm and welcoming as the ambiance strikes that perfect balance between casual and upscale.The service is everything you&#39;d expect from the no. 3 restaurant in the world: fast, attentive, gracious, and friendly. Our server was incredibly kind and put up with our selfies, questions, requests for information and clarification, and even shared some personal anecdotes -- which made the setting feel even more relaxed. The sommelier hit it out of the park when my friend asked for a &#34;funky strong fruity wine like they have in South Africa.&#34; A gorgeous Australian(?) chef came out and prepared a dish tableside (I almost tried to marry him as he was plating my lobster). The human element at EMP was a perfectly balanced whirling dervish of style, panache, and hospitality.Now to the food. God the food. Chef Humm really knows how to work his flavors. Less restrained than a more traditional fine dining establishment like Le Bernadin, EMP throws out bold combinations of flavors and textures, beautiful tableside presentations, and a sense of creatively with the dishes that makes you feel like the kitchen would be a really fun place to work.We opened with a gorgeous black and white savory cookie. Hints of apple and cheddar with a rich, flaky, crumbly texture. Delicious and the perfect way to start the meal off.Next, the sexy Australian chef comes out with a multi tiered rack of small appetizers. All vegetable based and presented beautifully; each bite was a celebration of the distinct flavors of its star vegetable.There are several amazing courses which I have to skip over b/c of character limits on these reviews (The sexy chef is nowhere to be found during these courses. I assume it&#39;s because he is planning our courtship). They are all very, very good. Trust me.My favorite dish of the night is EMPs take on Eggs Benedict. Small tins of egg yolk, ham and caviar are served alongside a quartet of adorable tiny biscuits. I could eat a wheelbarrow full of this stuff. The egg yolk and caviar is rich and unctuous with smoky ham flavor; and the biscuits are light and fluffy with just enough crunch on the crust so that you have that element of textural interest in the mouthfeel.Later in the meal, Sexy Chef returns with a large broiler pan filled with lobsters, clams, fennel, seaweed, and FIRE (the showmanship!).  I lose myself in my husband to be&#39;s eyes (and accent) as he pours a flask of fragrant white wine into the pan; and I&#39;m swept away in the aromatics of the fennel and the wine as a cloud of steam wafts up. My future husband then takes the broiler away. We almost have our first fight. He soon brings the lobster back on a plate and we make up. The lobster is served with an amazingly complex and delicate Uni mayonnaise and some kind of sauce made up of lobster juice and magic.One last highlight was from another &#34;choose your own adventure&#34; course. A choice btw a sweet potato with apple or butternut squash and bone marrow. I pick squash and my outraged companion chastises me for being from Texas and rejecting a sweet potato when there&#39;s one offered. I do not regret my choice. The smokey richness and umami of the bone marrow plays perfectly with the sweetness of the squash. Her sweet potato is perfectly cooked with a crispy outer skin and a beautifully pillowy interior. My companion eats large bites of my squash and I try not to stab her hand with my fork.As the evening progresses, there are more courses, amazing tea, decadent cheeses, and a very high stakes chocolate game at the end; all of which must be omitted for brevity&#39;s sake.

That was me.My review is probably harsh and nitpicky but I can list other restaurants that have outdone EMP in different areas.4 star service - wait staffs were attentive but they fell short personalization and synchronization.A)  Personalization - before arriving, EMP contacts you to see if it&#39;s a special occasion, if you have any food allergies or dietary restrictions. We went there for our anniversary and not that I am looking for complimentary toast or dessert but no one mentioned or congratulated us on our anniversary. That was a minor miss. The bigger misses were in the beginning. The wait staff asked again if we had any food allergies or food aversion. We said no. But the survey was already taken the day before so it would be nice for the staff to reconfirm our answer rather than re-asking the same question we already answered.B)  Synchronization - this is an observation on the party of 6 table in front of us where plates were not served in sync. It was a table of 3 ladies and 3 gentlemen with 3 wait staff serving. The plates came out the same time but placing it on the table was off and at one point a gentleman was served first before the plate was served to the lady (Big Gasp right?!?). This SUPER nitpicky but I always remember how well Del Posto executed their plate-serving synchronization when we went as a group of 5.3 star food/menu - there were no physical menus presented but the server spoke about the options. I personally appreciate visually seeing what&#39;s on the menu and the components in the dish so I can be more engaged with my dishes incase I have questions on the ingredients. The food itself was good but it was nothing mind blowing except for the caviar dish for me. That was amazing! The food in general was good but not memorable. It was bland and maybe it&#39;s the menu served that day but it&#39;s missing complexity. That especially goes for the lobster dish which is essentially the tail plus some bisque which by the way my husband had a piece of shell on his dish. The presentation was lacking. Same plates were used throughout the meal and nothing creative with plating. Our wine pairing glasses had more character than the plates. Per Se definitely takes the cake in everything but especially in presentation. One negative note on the food is the duck. I&#39;m a huge duck fan and whenever that&#39;s an option on the menu, that would be my go to. I felt mine was overcooked and had to send it back for a more medium/pink center one. The replacement one came and it was still over cooked to the point where it was super hard for me to cut with the smooth edge knife they served it with. I felt a serrated knife would be a more proper utensil pairing but they did not have any in the restaurant.4 star cocktail drinks - drinks were good and good presentation but of course it doesn&#39;t compare drinks at Flatiron Room, Raines Law Room, etc.3 star ambiance/dcor - the space is big and open with very high ceilings with a modern look but it&#39;s not warm, engaging or stimulating.

We had been following the remodel of EMP and were really looking forward to our meal. We left very satiated with no regrets.The ultimate takeaway of our experience was that for the cost, it was worth it, but only for a nice occasion. Would I necessarily be able to justify the high cost for just an average night - absolutely not. And for the high cost, was everything done impeccably? Close, but not quite. I&#39;ve had equally great food at a lower price point (eg, $150 pp vs $300 pp), but where EMP really sets itself above the rest is service. There was never a moment that we felt forgotten about. Napkins were folded, surfaces cleaned, shawls were delivered (for us perpetually shivering ladies!), and tablecloths were ironed (literally!). In terms of the food, at that cost and at 3 Michelin stars, I really expected to be WOW&#39;d by every single dish. Unfortunately, this was just not the case.STANDOUTS:- Starter bites: compressed apples dipped in foie gras caramel with apple almond crumble. Who would have known that tart apple and the sweetness of the caramel could be so well complimented by smooth and rich foie gras?!- Smoked sturgeon cheesecake with caviar: this one was communally served and an absolute showstopper! it tasted like an ultra luxurious bagel with lox and looked a million bucks. Could have taken it without the pickled cucumbers.- Seared warm foie gras dish with beets: This course was presented with various other options (clams with fennel, mushroom carpaccio, or the cold foie gras preparation with cabbage). I ended up choosing the clams, but this to me was the CLEAR winner. I would try to explain all the components of the dish, but frankly I am not sure (aside from the beets, there was a crunch component), and it was just indescribable. This is hands down one of the best things I&#39;ve ever tasted!- Roasted duck with honey and lavender: beautiful and impeccably executed from head to toe. The duck with succulent and juicy and the crusted skin with salt and honey provided just the right amount of texture to the dish.COULD HAVE DONE WITHOUT:- Starter bites: sweet potato tart. They compared it to a sweet potato pie when describing to us, but honestly it was a very sad, black sheep version. I feel like there are so many better things that can be done with a sweet potato.- Clams with fennel: while visually beautiful and labor intensive, I just found the taste to be one note: surfer clams, with clam mouse, and dill. It felt like it was missing something and it was not the most pleasing texture.- Kale seasonal side with egg yolk: There was something underneath the kale (perhaps a kale puree) that was a very deep green color with a bitter taste and displeasing texture. Honestly, I wasn&#39;t sure what it was and it was the only thing we ate all night that was left on the plate.- Wine pairings: Unfortunately, we were not impressed by a majority of the pairings chosen and would probably do without this the next time around.For the experience as a whole (food, service, kitchen tour), we had a great night. But for the overall bill, it just felt like there were certain areas that could have been improved. For $300 a person, I think the kabocha squash course and cheddar with pretzel and beer could be improved/elevated (lovely, just not something I would expect at this pricepoint).

The overall atmosphere was casual and not as stuck up as I thought it would be.With the tasting menu, we tried a variety of dishes. The most memorable for me was the celery root being cooked inside an animal&#39;s stomach I believe, and they do this at your table. Another great dish was their oysters which was served two ways on one plate: savory and sweet. So delectable. My favorite though was the lobster dish. Bursting with flavor and perfectly cooked. I liked their savory dishes more than the sweet. As we go through each dish, I notice their flavors are more traditional. I tasted a lot of maple syrup and apple flavors in multiple courses, but the presentation is always creative and out of the box.As a final treat after all that good food, they also gave us some homemade granola to go as a nice parting gift.

Well, I stand corrected, EMP has definitely earned its title as best restaurant in the world (per 2017&#39;s San Pellegrino&#39;s list). For those of you that like me, may have been living under a rock these last several years, EMP offers an 11-course tasting menu (estimated to take about 3.5 hours to get through) and a policy of asking for payment when the reservation is booked (leaving you to only pay for your drinks on the night of the reservation). Since EMP is slated to close this summer in order to undergo huge kitchen and dining room reservations, the menu they are currently offering is their greatest hits dishes from over the year.Every dish was amazing. From the simpler (in presentation anyway) dishes such as gougeres with grated gruyere to grinding up carrots tableside for their carrot tartare dish or serving a turbot with zucchini scales, everything was phenomenal. My personal favority was a foie gras torchon which maple syrup on the inside.The service was top notch as well. I asked for one of the hostess&#39;s where the ladies room and waited for her to give the regular &#34;turn right/left and walk down the corridor...&#34; instructions. But not at EMP. Here I was escorted all the way to the door of the ladies room.The pacing of the meal was excellent as well. Since it was just two of us for dinner and we didn&#39;t end up drinking, we finished up after about 2.5 hours. However, it seemed that we were not the norm as we finished far in advance of the other tables that were leisurely enjoying their wine pairing, etc.My favorite part of the meal had to be our interaction with the general manager(?) at the end. We ordered tableside tea (more curious about what that entailed than anything else) and were treated with a wonderful presentation where he discussed and demonstrated a one versus three-steeping process and answered our questions about the restaurant renovations and what would happen to the staff (they are opening a pop-up restaurant over the summer in the Hampton&#39;s and a major driver of that decision was to provide employment to their best asset... their people).Lastly, they finished off the meal with offering us a complementary glass of brandy for my husband and sparkling (non-alcoholic) cider for me. I was very impressed with how well they were paying attention. My husband had ordered 1-drink at the bar while (due to a crappy cold) I ordered two non-alcoholic drinks and mostly drank water at the table. The waitstaff, with everything else going on, was able to notice that my husband would be inclined to drink the brandy, while correctly surmising that I would need to go the non-alcoholic route.The final impressive touch came with our parting gift. Most of the high-end restaurants are now in the habit of providing an extra food treat to take home and EMP was no exception, except that instead of a tiny tin of cookies or chocolate, we received two large glass canisters of granola.", "Ratings": 5.0, "Reviewcount": "47", "coolvote": "7", "Usefulvote": "13", "Friendcount": "73", "funnyvote": "4", "No_of_checkin": "", "No_of_Photos": "159", "Review_length": 531}, {"Review ": "I had been several years ago and was a bit underwhelmed but decided to make a reservation in the bar for dinner since it reopened.

Unfortunately, here is my honest review of the place.Before I even go into the details, let me start by saying this is indeed an amazing restaurant. But if it is deemed the best of the best, then I will hold it by those standards. It did fall short of those expectations and as such, I&#39;m giving it a 3 star rating. It may be harsh, but you&#39;re spending a significant amount for an incredible experience so you have to be better than just better than the next guy.Pros:- Even before you get to the restaurant, someone personally reaches out to you to make sure everything is perfect. It&#39;s a great personal touch.- There were some great dishes, the lobster bisque sauce was perfect. The pretzel was amazing. I also really enjoyed the veal.- The staff is very friendly and mostly attentive.- The kitchen tour was a nice touch, especially to show off the new set upCons:- The dinner is too long. I believe it was purposely done as to not make you feel rushed but the courses had 30 minute gaps in some places. We had a 6:15 start and didn&#39;t finish until around 10:20.- The dishes were good but not amazing. I can&#39;t honestly say any one dish blew me away.- At one point, one of the servers spilled my wine glass on me. Now this wasn&#39;t a big deal on its own, as mistakes happen. It was more of how it was handled that was a bit upsetting for a restaurant of this caliber. So after she spilled the wine on my jacket, she picked up the glass and placed it back on my table. She apologized and handed me a towel. Another member of the waitstaff also came over to help clean up and hand me additional towels. All great until I look up and see my empty and sticky wine glass sitting on the table. I&#39;m not expecting a freebie but I&#39;ve been to much lesser restaurants where they would come back with a new glass at least. At the end, I had to ask for a new one myself. Normally not a huge deal, but if you&#39;re the best restaurant in the world...Overall, EMP is a great dining establishment and anyone would be lucky to go.

Needless to say, I was ecstatic at the prospect of dining at not only the best restaurant in America, but the #3 restaurant in the world! Having dined at many other high-end restaurants I was excited, but also nervous, about not wanting to be let down with lofty expectations. However, from the moment we stepped into EMP, our magical evening began on a great foot by the immaculate decor and the impeccable service.We opted for a 5 course vegetarian tasting menu with wine pairings for our Valentine&#39;s Day meal. My husband had surprised me with an all-Riesling wine pairing (my favorite wine), which was an added bonus! Some of the Rieslings that were part of this pairing ranged from $150/bottle-over $400/bottle, so you can imagine how delicious and wonderfully paired our meal was. Onto the food, which was quite possibly, the most flavorful meal I&#39;ve ever had. What I enjoyed most about the vegetarian tasting menu was that the food may have looked somewhat simple at first glance, but once you took a bite of food, you quickly realized how much complexity and depth of flavors and textures was hidden in every bite. I absolutely loved the cauliflower play on caviar, the sweet potato with jus, the kohlrabi salad, and the mushroom risotto!There were also small touches that made the experience extremely personalized and distinguished it from other high-end restaurants, such as, the private tour of the kitchen, complete with a cocktail, the sea salt pretzel and cocktail at the end of the meal, and the granola parting gift (best granola ever!!).My husband and I have already decided we are going to be back for the 10-12 course pairing menu the next time we&#39;re in NYC!", "Ratings": 5.0, "Reviewcount": "94", "coolvote": "", "Usefulvote": "1", "Friendcount": "25", "funnyvote": "", "No_of_checkin": 0, "No_of_Photos": "24", "Review_length": 299}, {"Review ": "I don&#39;t typically leave reviews for places outside of my yelp territory but this place definitely deserves the praise.I&#39;ve read about Eleven Madison Park for years, saw it kept its 3 Michelin stars AND made #3 best restaurant in the WORLD this year.

We planned our next foodie trip from Seattle to New York and made dinner reservations months in advance.As soon as we arrived, service was everything you&#39;d think it would be.. everyone was attentive, knowledgeable, personable; they just seemed like they enjoyed being there and were really passionate about the industry they are in. About 20 different people served our table throughout the night. One gentleman really knew his scotch and my boyfriend was very impressed with that!The food, I&#39;ve read mixed reviews about it but for me.. everything was amazing! Lots of intense flavors, mixed textures, supple meats, and overall just a personalized and truly unique dining experience! My favorite part, I had requested a kitchen tour while the maitre d was out of office and wasn&#39;t sure if we&#39;d get to see it. But towards the end of our dinner a man dressed in a suit walks up to the table, bends down closer to us and asks, &#34;are you ready to see the kitchen?&#34; And my hearts starts pounding! It was so exciting to go back there and see where the magic happens! He gave us a mini tour and had another kind lady fix us up a wonderful cocktail!

Did the bar tasting which means it was 2-3hours vs. the table which is 5 hours. The bar tasting had 5 courses which was sufficient enough for me.Service was obviously impeccable and lovely ambiance. You get to choose between certain courses. I picked the duck over the oxtail (good choice on my part). I honestly had an amazing thing here.

But that said, I have dined at almost ten 3 michelin starred restaurants and several 2 and 1 starred restaurants...and this one barely deserves 1 star when compared to my experiences. There are plenty of other 3-starred restaurants in NYC that are far superior than this one. So for a price tag of about $400/pp (after taxes and beverages), go elsewhere. If you dont want to read the whole review, let me illustrate it in a few senctences. My husband is a huge lover of cheese and he was starving by the time we arrived for dinner. Near the end, there was a cheese course. Not only did I think it was gross, but my hungry cheese-loving husband couldn&#39;t even finish it. And no, the waiters did not ask if there was something wrong nor was a replacement offered.Now, let me break this down:1. Service: pretty standard 3 michelin quality service. Attentive and meticulous. But do they go above of and beyond? No. We came a week after our wedding and they were aware of this. We had just finished a trip to Napa and perhaps we had been spoiled, but nearly every place we went, they somehow acknowledged this point with a complimentary toast or small dessert or even a congratulatory note in the end. Now if you go somewhere and say it&#39;s your birthday or anniversary or honeymoon, i don&#39;t expect every restaurant to do something special, but hey, my standards are high when the price tag calls for perfection. Another point: there were definitely gaps between dishes when we had nothing in front of us. We weren&#39;t eating too fast. The couple next to us experienced the same thing. No, not when I am paying for perfection, I don&#39;t expect to wait 10 minutes between courses.2. Food taste: the flavors were all over the place but overall uninteresting and bland.  And they have some sort of obsession with radishes. They might be going for some theme, but there was definitely some pickled radish or sour pickled vegetable on 3 straight dishes. Where&#39;s the variety in flavor and texture?3. Food presentation: this is where it all falls apart to the point of zero stars, to the point of utter disappointment. With the exception of perhaps the first 2 and last courses, the colors were very white and single toned. The presentation was also very boring. Again, standards are higher for a 3 michelin star affair and one always eats with their eyes before their mouths. And i could barely swallow at the appearance of some of the dishes. White on white yells &#34;i don&#39;t care about this dish.&#34;4. Ambiance and decor: average. Overall nice with high ceilings. However, the corner cushioned seats we sat in were dirtied with crumbs. I wonder if the prior patrons had left some crumbs. But again this lack of attention to details is quite upsetting. Who wants to skooch into a seat only to discover your sitting on gritty crumbs??!5. Last note. They come with a wonderful presentation of a baked Alaska for dessert. The torching is on an ~8 inch diameter dessert. They then take it away to prepare the dessert for you...when they return, you get a piece the size of a half-dollar coin. Where&#39;s the rest of my baked Alaska? Also, my husband feels a similar shrinkage in size occurred with the lobster dish, but I thought maybe the crustacean naturally shrinks after cooking...who knows.Seriously, I have never felt that my money went to waste when I&#39;ve dined at a 3 Michelin star restaurant, but here I felt gypped.", "Ratings": 1.0, "Reviewcount": "120", "coolvote": "5", "Usefulvote": "51", "Friendcount": "98", "funnyvote": "24", "No_of_checkin": 0, "No_of_Photos": "33", "Review_length": 623}, {"Review ": "Came here for my boyfriend&#39;s birthday and it was better than I remember (I had come for lunch last time in summer 2013, so was very excited to return for dinner).First of all the service is spectacular. Someone reached out to me about a week before asking if there was anything special the restaurant could do because we were celebrating a birthday. That same person greeted us at the door when we walked in and remembered it was my boyfriend&#39;s birthday.Everyone else was also so attentive, and the attention to detail was incredible. The atmosphere, though elegant was not pretentious and many people (ourself included) were often see chatting away with the staff and laughing with them. Lucy Liu was also dining 2 tables down from us!We had about 4-5 glasses of wine each to pair with our food (we didn&#39;t want to do a full tasting, 8 glasses of wine is just too many), and the sommelier was wonderful and picked great pairings based on our descriptions of what kind of wine we like.On to food:They adapted everything for my boyfriend to be gluten free, from the tarts to the breads to the crumbles, it was very impressive that they were able to make all of his items gluten free.The first thing they bring is the black and white cookie in a box, which was a savory cookie with apple and cheddar; it&#39;s very cheesy and delicious.They then bring an assortment of small bites: parsnip pie, celery root with black truffle, rutabaga with celery and walnuts and salsify with garlic and thyme. My favorite was the celery root and parsnip pie.Then main dishes were the following:Caviar Benedict with smoked sturgeon, diced ham and picked egg yolk. I love caviar (who doesn&#39;t) but don&#39;t love ham flavor and still found it to be awesome.Foie Gras marinated with black truffle and mushroom - holy moly this was delicious. The bread they served with it was croissant like and was perfect. There&#39;s also an option for seared foie gras, but I prefer chilled, maybe will try seated next time if they still have it.Lobster, which was smoked and steamed at the table and then taken back to be plated, with fennel, clam and bouillabaisse. I don&#39;t like licorice flavor, but the fennel was not overpowering.For the vegetable course I chose the Butternut squash, which was roasted with bone marrow and pumpkin seeds and my boyfriend got sweet potato wrapped in bacon with maple syrup glaze. Both were very delicious.For the main dish, there was a choice between duck and oxtail. I chose the duck, which was glazed with honey and lavender with plum and onion. The skin was perfectly crispy and there were subtle Indian flavors on the skin from cumin. I would&#39;ve preferred a sweeter glaze, but the duck was still delicious and cooked perfectly. My boyfriend enjoyed his oxtail but I thought the duck was better.They give you 2 side dishes with the main course: Brussel sprouts roasted with bone marrow and pumpkin seeds, which were amazing and parsnip pure with variations of juniper, also very good.After the main course was a cheese course with bitter greens, which for me was basically a deep fried cheeseball and was delicious. My boyfriend&#39;s version wasn&#39;t deep fried.For dessert we chose the baked Alaska, which was huge and prepared table side. Though tasty it was a bit too sweet and alcohol flavored for me to finish.There&#39;s also the fun game where you match the chocolate bars with the type of milk (cow, buffalo, sheep and goat), I got the sheep and goat right, but switched the cow and buffalo.The chocolate covered pretzel with sea salt was delicious and gluten free!Overall I&#39;m glad I finally returned for dinner.

This restaurant has the potential to be amazing, the type of place you would go to for a milestone celebration, but everything was just a smidge off.When I arrived, there were two hosts, one on the phone who completely did not acknowledge us (which is fine, she&#39;s on the phone), and a second one who just happened to be in the process of seating someone else. He returned after a couple of minutes, I provided him with the reservation information, and shortly after we were seated in the dining area.I started with the mocktail &#34;N/A-GRONI&#34; which was comprised of San Bitters, Grapefruit &amp; Club Soda, if you enjoy San Pellegrino flavored sodas, you&#39;ll definitely enjoy this.We started off with the complimentary &#34;Angel Bread&#34; with goat cheese butter. The roll was delightful, warm, fluffy, sweet - a perfect foil for the earthiness of the goat cheese butter.First lunch course was Ruby Red Shrimp, Romano Beans, Almonds, Harissa - I enjoyed the crunchiness of the beans with the almonds and the spiciness of the harissa, but sadly, the shrimp, which should have been the highlight of the dish underwhelmed me, it was just a little more well done than I prefer my shrimp to be.Second course was pork loin, belly and sausage - nothing wrong with meat in this dish, I just wasn&#39;t inspired by this, each bite was again, just good. The squash under the meat was a little over-ripe so the rind was a tad chewy.After the first course, there was an inordinately long wait for the second course, so long that while we had originally planned to order dessert, we had to pass in order to make it to our next function on time (we were seated for a little over two hours). When we had finished our first course, one server hovered while waiting for other servers to become available so that our empty plates could be removed at the same time.

There were four hosts crowding around a computer screen, busily sorting out tables, but not one person raised their head to greet us. We waited patiently and after a few minutes, one finally looked up and welcomed the older white couple behind us and invited them in. It was like we didn&#39;t even exist!

Both my mother and father left stunned by the nuanced, thoughtful recipes that Michael Anthony adds to classic American recipes. This restaurant is really one of best in the Country.For lunch, my father and I had one of the specials, which was a roasted corn soup with a waygo beef, roast beef sandwich. The soup was delicate with olive oil floating on the surface. Each spoonful was full of roasted, smoked corn. It was a lovely soup. The roast beef sandwich was on a crusty bun with cartelized onions and layers of rare Waygo beef. It was beautiful.My mother ordered the Cavatelli with squash and smoked mushrooms. It was topped with shaved pecorino cheese. I had one bite and it was beautiful dish of fresh pasta with Fall vegetables.We were too full for the dessert menu, but it look very good.Again, Gramercy Tavern delivered one of the most impressive meals I have had.

Thank god everyone I was with went for the tasting menu so I could indulge fully. Also thank god I wasn&#39;t paying for it. Unfortunately, business meals mean pulling out a phone to take pictures is frowned upon and, coupled with the copious drinks, my memory of this is now hazy.I will say that Gramercy Tavern is no longer on the cutting edge-- many of the dishes I had here I&#39;ve seen elsewhere. A couple different fish dishes (one decent, one stellar), an excellent duck breast, a gazpacho; it all looked and tasted a bit like the usual suspects. Only a couple of things were trying to show off, like the tomato-basil ice cream at the end. But the level of execution is so high, and everything so simply delicious, that I&#39;ll excuse it. Everything tasted like summer gently bridging into fall.What also pushes them over the top for me is an uncommonly good beverage program, with many by-the-glass wines, a wide selection of nightcaps, and fantastic pairings. Service is, as always, strong.I think if I looked back at what we paid and the reputation, I could split hairs about some of the dishes here; I don&#39;t know that it&#39;s &#34;best in the world.&#34; But as it was, I practically floated out of the restaurant.

We knew about the long wait for a table and reservation which required to be made far ahead so we decided to turn up anyway to try our luck. We have watched Youtube videos and read many reviews about this place and as we are fans of Tom Colicchio of Top Chef, and knowing his successor, Michael Anthony has taken this place to new heights, we knew we would not go wrong coming here.First impression - this place is beautiful, has an old style interior decor - leather &amp; wood, fresh flowers everywhere but a little noisy as the seating is intimate. Put our name down for both the bar and a table and stood at the bar waiting for whichever became available first. Bar staff were friendly and attentive even though they had their hands full serving seated customers. We got our drinks about five minutes of being there.About 20 mins into our wait, we were approached by a sharply dressed gentleman to head to our table. What a pleasant surprise as we were told that it would be 45 min to an hour&#39;s wait.Immediately, we were given water and our wait staff Elizabeth came over to introduce herself and gave us the menu. While we were mulling over what to order, the Head Chef came over and offered his recommendations. What a treat! Michael Anthony was a super nice guy as we never would have expected someone this important and busy to wait on us. We even had a little conversation about food, tennis and Massachusetts oysters!We had the app of seafood tower, entrees of duck sausage and pork fried rice and dessert of berries and cream with Panna Cotta. Drank Syrah from Vallin Santa Barbara and cocktail of sour whiskey.We had a great meal that night! The seafood tower was amazingly memorable - it consisted of Island Creek oysters, grilled shrimps, poke of some white fish, apple kimchi (the best!), lobster salad and several pickled dishes mushroom and veggies.

Yes.Gramery Tavern was definitely a highlight from my NY trip. The service was impeccable (you know you&#39;re at a legit classy restaurant when they fold your napkins if you leave your table for a minute), but also not stuffy. There is a coat check if you need it, and any leftover &#39;ok-to-package&#39; desserts will be waiting for you wrapped up upon your exit from the restaurant. There is a three-course option and a seven course meal with optional wine pairings. Their only ask is that everyone at your table order either the three- or the seven- course meal because of the timing of the dishes. On this visit we enjoyed the three course prix fixe meal and the restaurant kept us on track so we would have plenty of time to head over to see a show.Our meal started with an amuse bouche of biscuits with goat milk butter and cabbage salad. I started with the ricotta cavatelli which had creamy noodles with a beef bolognese, black olives, and pickled peppers. It was a bit on the salty side, but I ate the whole thing because, mmm, salt. Also, I love beef bolognese! My main course was the arctic char served medium well with celery root, quince, and delicately-placed Brussels sprouts leaves. They give you a hearty portion of salmon; I would have liked more of the accompanying items on my plate. The star of the dish: the salmon skin. It was perfectly crisp and salty. For dessert I had a trio of sorbets - raspberry, strawberry, and concord grape. They were served on a bed of cookies. Each flavor was vibrant and refreshing, but also very sweet. I also had a ginger swizzle and hot mint tea to wash down all the good food. To finish, our meal came with petit fours - two kinds of chocolatey bon bons. One was reminiscent of a PB&amp;J and the other had fantastic crisps inside. We also were given a special Gramercy Tavern granola bar for later.My friend had the butternut squash soup, pork loin &amp; belly, and cookie plate. She loved everything and even got to take home the leftover cookies.This is a great place to celebrate a milestone occasion or for a just-because night out.

All were enjoyable as we browsed through the menu. Per recommendation from our waiter, we decided on getting two appetizers &amp; two main entrees. Everything was ordered at the beginning and the meal was paced by the kitchen.The appetizers we got were the Asparagus Salad &amp; Cavetelli with Pesto. The Asparagus Salad was light &amp; fresh, I was surprised by how good it tasted with the tarter sauce. The Cavatelli was as expected; the pesto was tasty &amp; the pasta was cooked very well.For the entrees, I got the Grilled Shrimp &amp; Carrot Stew and my husband got the Lasagna. The stew had a different kind of flavor &amp; the broth was the most enjoyable part. I didn&#39;t realize there was going to be any fish in it along with the shrimp so that was a nice surprise!

That was me.My review is probably harsh and nitpicky but I can list other restaurants that have outdone EMP in different areas.4 star service - wait staffs were attentive but they fell short personalization and synchronization.A)  Personalization - before arriving, EMP contacts you to see if it&#39;s a special occasion, if you have any food allergies or dietary restrictions. We went there for our anniversary and not that I am looking for complimentary toast or dessert but no one mentioned or congratulated us on our anniversary. That was a minor miss. The bigger misses were in the beginning. The wait staff asked again if we had any food allergies or food aversion. We said no. But the survey was already taken the day before so it would be nice for the staff to reconfirm our answer rather than re-asking the same question we already answered.B)  Synchronization - this is an observation on the party of 6 table in front of us where plates were not served in sync. It was a table of 3 ladies and 3 gentlemen with 3 wait staff serving. The plates came out the same time but placing it on the table was off and at one point a gentleman was served first before the plate was served to the lady (Big Gasp right?!?). This SUPER nitpicky but I always remember how well Del Posto executed their plate-serving synchronization when we went as a group of 5.3 star food/menu - there were no physical menus presented but the server spoke about the options. I personally appreciate visually seeing what&#39;s on the menu and the components in the dish so I can be more engaged with my dishes incase I have questions on the ingredients. The food itself was good but it was nothing mind blowing except for the caviar dish for me. That was amazing! The food in general was good but not memorable. It was bland and maybe it&#39;s the menu served that day but it&#39;s missing complexity. That especially goes for the lobster dish which is essentially the tail plus some bisque which by the way my husband had a piece of shell on his dish. The presentation was lacking. Same plates were used throughout the meal and nothing creative with plating. Our wine pairing glasses had more character than the plates. Per Se definitely takes the cake in everything but especially in presentation. One negative note on the food is the duck. I&#39;m a huge duck fan and whenever that&#39;s an option on the menu, that would be my go to. I felt mine was overcooked and had to send it back for a more medium/pink center one. The replacement one came and it was still over cooked to the point where it was super hard for me to cut with the smooth edge knife they served it with. I felt a serrated knife would be a more proper utensil pairing but they did not have any in the restaurant.4 star cocktail drinks - drinks were good and good presentation but of course it doesn&#39;t compare drinks at Flatiron Room, Raines Law Room, etc.3 star ambiance/dcor - the space is big and open with very high ceilings with a modern look but it&#39;s not warm, engaging or stimulating.

We had been following the remodel of EMP and were really looking forward to our meal. We left very satiated with no regrets.The ultimate takeaway of our experience was that for the cost, it was worth it, but only for a nice occasion. Would I necessarily be able to justify the high cost for just an average night - absolutely not. And for the high cost, was everything done impeccably? Close, but not quite. I&#39;ve had equally great food at a lower price point (eg, $150 pp vs $300 pp), but where EMP really sets itself above the rest is service. There was never a moment that we felt forgotten about. Napkins were folded, surfaces cleaned, shawls were delivered (for us perpetually shivering ladies!), and tablecloths were ironed (literally!). In terms of the food, at that cost and at 3 Michelin stars, I really expected to be WOW&#39;d by every single dish. Unfortunately, this was just not the case.STANDOUTS:- Starter bites: compressed apples dipped in foie gras caramel with apple almond crumble. Who would have known that tart apple and the sweetness of the caramel could be so well complimented by smooth and rich foie gras?!- Smoked sturgeon cheesecake with caviar: this one was communally served and an absolute showstopper! it tasted like an ultra luxurious bagel with lox and looked a million bucks. Could have taken it without the pickled cucumbers.- Seared warm foie gras dish with beets: This course was presented with various other options (clams with fennel, mushroom carpaccio, or the cold foie gras preparation with cabbage). I ended up choosing the clams, but this to me was the CLEAR winner. I would try to explain all the components of the dish, but frankly I am not sure (aside from the beets, there was a crunch component), and it was just indescribable. This is hands down one of the best things I&#39;ve ever tasted!- Roasted duck with honey and lavender: beautiful and impeccably executed from head to toe. The duck with succulent and juicy and the crusted skin with salt and honey provided just the right amount of texture to the dish.COULD HAVE DONE WITHOUT:- Starter bites: sweet potato tart. They compared it to a sweet potato pie when describing to us, but honestly it was a very sad, black sheep version. I feel like there are so many better things that can be done with a sweet potato.- Clams with fennel: while visually beautiful and labor intensive, I just found the taste to be one note: surfer clams, with clam mouse, and dill. It felt like it was missing something and it was not the most pleasing texture.- Kale seasonal side with egg yolk: There was something underneath the kale (perhaps a kale puree) that was a very deep green color with a bitter taste and displeasing texture. Honestly, I wasn&#39;t sure what it was and it was the only thing we ate all night that was left on the plate.- Wine pairings: Unfortunately, we were not impressed by a majority of the pairings chosen and would probably do without this the next time around.For the experience as a whole (food, service, kitchen tour), we had a great night. But for the overall bill, it just felt like there were certain areas that could have been improved. For $300 a person, I think the kabocha squash course and cheddar with pretzel and beer could be improved/elevated (lovely, just not something I would expect at this pricepoint).

Another great dish was their oysters which was served two ways on one plate: savory and sweet. So delectable. My favorite though was the lobster dish. Bursting with flavor and perfectly cooked. I liked their savory dishes more than the sweet. As we go through each dish, I notice their flavors are more traditional. I tasted a lot of maple syrup and apple flavors in multiple courses, but the presentation is always creative and out of the box.As a final treat after all that good food, they also gave us some homemade granola to go as a nice parting gift.

Well, I stand corrected, EMP has definitely earned its title as best restaurant in the world (per 2017&#39;s San Pellegrino&#39;s list). For those of you that like me, may have been living under a rock these last several years, EMP offers an 11-course tasting menu (estimated to take about 3.5 hours to get through) and a policy of asking for payment when the reservation is booked (leaving you to only pay for your drinks on the night of the reservation). Since EMP is slated to close this summer in order to undergo huge kitchen and dining room reservations, the menu they are currently offering is their greatest hits dishes from over the year.Every dish was amazing. From the simpler (in presentation anyway) dishes such as gougeres with grated gruyere to grinding up carrots tableside for their carrot tartare dish or serving a turbot with zucchini scales, everything was phenomenal. My personal favority was a foie gras torchon which maple syrup on the inside.The service was top notch as well. I asked for one of the hostess&#39;s where the ladies room and waited for her to give the regular &#34;turn right/left and walk down the corridor...&#34; instructions. But not at EMP. Here I was escorted all the way to the door of the ladies room.The pacing of the meal was excellent as well. Since it was just two of us for dinner and we didn&#39;t end up drinking, we finished up after about 2.5 hours. However, it seemed that we were not the norm as we finished far in advance of the other tables that were leisurely enjoying their wine pairing, etc.My favorite part of the meal had to be our interaction with the general manager(?) at the end. We ordered tableside tea (more curious about what that entailed than anything else) and were treated with a wonderful presentation where he discussed and demonstrated a one versus three-steeping process and answered our questions about the restaurant renovations and what would happen to the staff (they are opening a pop-up restaurant over the summer in the Hampton&#39;s and a major driver of that decision was to provide employment to their best asset... their people).Lastly, they finished off the meal with offering us a complementary glass of brandy for my husband and sparkling (non-alcoholic) cider for me. I was very impressed with how well they were paying attention. My husband had ordered 1-drink at the bar while (due to a crappy cold) I ordered two non-alcoholic drinks and mostly drank water at the table. The waitstaff, with everything else going on, was able to notice that my husband would be inclined to drink the brandy, while correctly surmising that I would need to go the non-alcoholic route.The final impressive touch came with our parting gift. Most of the high-end restaurants are now in the habit of providing an extra food treat to take home and EMP was no exception, except that instead of a tiny tin of cookies or chocolate, we received two large glass canisters of granola.", "Ratings": 5.0, "Reviewcount": "47", "coolvote": "7", "Usefulvote": "13", "Friendcount": "73", "funnyvote": "4", "No_of_checkin": "", "No_of_Photos": "159", "Review_length": 531}, {"Review ": "I had been several years ago and was a bit underwhelmed but decided to make a reservation in the bar for dinner since it reopened.

Unfortunately, here is my honest review of the place.Before I even go into the details, let me start by saying this is indeed an amazing restaurant. But if it is deemed the best of the best, then I will hold it by those standards. It did fall short of those expectations and as such, I&#39;m giving it a 3 star rating. It may be harsh, but you&#39;re spending a significant amount for an incredible experience so you have to be better than just better than the next guy.Pros:- Even before you get to the restaurant, someone personally reaches out to you to make sure everything is perfect. It&#39;s a great personal touch.- There were some great dishes, the lobster bisque sauce was perfect. The pretzel was amazing. I also really enjoyed the veal.- The staff is very friendly and mostly attentive.- The kitchen tour was a nice touch, especially to show off the new set upCons:- The dinner is too long. I believe it was purposely done as to not make you feel rushed but the courses had 30 minute gaps in some places. We had a 6:15 start and didn&#39;t finish until around 10:20.- The dishes were good but not amazing. I can&#39;t honestly say any one dish blew me away.- At one point, one of the servers spilled my wine glass on me. Now this wasn&#39;t a big deal on its own, as mistakes happen. It was more of how it was handled that was a bit upsetting for a restaurant of this caliber. So after she spilled the wine on my jacket, she picked up the glass and placed it back on my table. She apologized and handed me a towel. Another member of the waitstaff also came over to help clean up and hand me additional towels. All great until I look up and see my empty and sticky wine glass sitting on the table. I&#39;m not expecting a freebie but I&#39;ve been to much lesser restaurants where they would come back with a new glass at least. At the end, I had to ask for a new one myself. Normally not a huge deal, but if you&#39;re the best restaurant in the world...Overall, EMP is a great dining establishment and anyone would be lucky to go.

Needless to say, I was ecstatic at the prospect of dining at not only the best restaurant in America, but the #3 restaurant in the world! Having dined at many other high-end restaurants I was excited, but also nervous, about not wanting to be let down with lofty expectations. However, from the moment we stepped into EMP, our magical evening began on a great foot by the immaculate decor and the impeccable service.We opted for a 5 course vegetarian tasting menu with wine pairings for our Valentine&#39;s Day meal. My husband had surprised me with an all-Riesling wine pairing (my favorite wine), which was an added bonus! Some of the Rieslings that were part of this pairing ranged from $150/bottle-over $400/bottle, so you can imagine how delicious and wonderfully paired our meal was. Onto the food, which was quite possibly, the most flavorful meal I&#39;ve ever had. What I enjoyed most about the vegetarian tasting menu was that the food may have looked somewhat simple at first glance, but once you took a bite of food, you quickly realized how much complexity and depth of flavors and textures was hidden in every bite. I absolutely loved the cauliflower play on caviar, the sweet potato with jus, the kohlrabi salad, and the mushroom risotto!There were also small touches that made the experience extremely personalized and distinguished it from other high-end restaurants, such as, the private tour of the kitchen, complete with a cocktail, the sea salt pretzel and cocktail at the end of the meal, and the granola parting gift (best granola ever!!).My husband and I have already decided we are going to be back for the 10-12 course pairing menu the next time we&#39;re in NYC!", "Ratings": 5.0, "Reviewcount": "94", "coolvote": "", "Usefulvote": "1", "Friendcount": "25", "funnyvote": "", "No_of_checkin": 0, "No_of_Photos": "24", "Review_length": 299}, {"Review ": "I don&#39;t typically leave reviews for places outside of my yelp territory but this place definitely deserves the praise.I&#39;ve read about Eleven Madison Park for years, saw it kept its 3 Michelin stars AND made #3 best restaurant in the WORLD this year.

We planned our next foodie trip from Seattle to New York and made dinner reservations months in advance.As soon as we arrived, service was everything you&#39;d think it would be.. everyone was attentive, knowledgeable, personable; they just seemed like they enjoyed being there and were really passionate about the industry they are in. About 20 different people served our table throughout the night. One gentleman really knew his scotch and my boyfriend was very impressed with that!The food, I&#39;ve read mixed reviews about it but for me.. everything was amazing! Lots of intense flavors, mixed textures, supple meats, and overall just a personalized and truly unique dining experience! My favorite part, I had requested a kitchen tour while the maitre d was out of office and wasn&#39;t sure if we&#39;d get to see it. But towards the end of our dinner a man dressed in a suit walks up to the table, bends down closer to us and asks, &#34;are you ready to see the kitchen?&#34; And my hearts starts pounding! It was so exciting to go back there and see where the magic happens! He gave us a mini tour and had another kind lady fix us up a wonderful cocktail!

But that said, I have dined at almost ten 3 michelin starred restaurants and several 2 and 1 starred restaurants...and this one barely deserves 1 star when compared to my experiences. There are plenty of other 3-starred restaurants in NYC that are far superior than this one. So for a price tag of about $400/pp (after taxes and beverages), go elsewhere. If you dont want to read the whole review, let me illustrate it in a few senctences. My husband is a huge lover of cheese and he was starving by the time we arrived for dinner. Near the end, there was a cheese course. Not only did I think it was gross, but my hungry cheese-loving husband couldn&#39;t even finish it. And no, the waiters did not ask if there was something wrong nor was a replacement offered.Now, let me break this down:1. Service: pretty standard 3 michelin quality service. Attentive and meticulous. But do they go above of and beyond? No. We came a week after our wedding and they were aware of this. We had just finished a trip to Napa and perhaps we had been spoiled, but nearly every place we went, they somehow acknowledged this point with a complimentary toast or small dessert or even a congratulatory note in the end. Now if you go somewhere and say it&#39;s your birthday or anniversary or honeymoon, i don&#39;t expect every restaurant to do something special, but hey, my standards are high when the price tag calls for perfection. Another point: there were definitely gaps between dishes when we had nothing in front of us. We weren&#39;t eating too fast. The couple next to us experienced the same thing. No, not when I am paying for perfection, I don&#39;t expect to wait 10 minutes between courses.2. Food taste: the flavors were all over the place but overall uninteresting and bland.  And they have some sort of obsession with radishes. They might be going for some theme, but there was definitely some pickled radish or sour pickled vegetable on 3 straight dishes. Where&#39;s the variety in flavor and texture?3. Food presentation: this is where it all falls apart to the point of zero stars, to the point of utter disappointment. With the exception of perhaps the first 2 and last courses, the colors were very white and single toned. The presentation was also very boring. Again, standards are higher for a 3 michelin star affair and one always eats with their eyes before their mouths. And i could barely swallow at the appearance of some of the dishes. White on white yells &#34;i don&#39;t care about this dish.&#34;4. Ambiance and decor: average. Overall nice with high ceilings. However, the corner cushioned seats we sat in were dirtied with crumbs. I wonder if the prior patrons had left some crumbs. But again this lack of attention to details is quite upsetting. Who wants to skooch into a seat only to discover your sitting on gritty crumbs??!5. Last note. They come with a wonderful presentation of a baked Alaska for dessert. The torching is on an ~8 inch diameter dessert. They then take it away to prepare the dessert for you...when they return, you get a piece the size of a half-dollar coin. Where&#39;s the rest of my baked Alaska? Also, my husband feels a similar shrinkage in size occurred with the lobster dish, but I thought maybe the crustacean naturally shrinks after cooking...who knows.Seriously, I have never felt that my money went to waste when I&#39;ve dined at a 3 Michelin star restaurant, but here I felt gypped.", "Ratings": 1.0, "Reviewcount": "120", "coolvote": "5", "Usefulvote": "51", "Friendcount": "98", "funnyvote": "24", "No_of_checkin": 0, "No_of_Photos": "33", "Review_length": 623}, {"Review ": "Came here for my boyfriend&#39;s birthday and it was better than I remember (I had come for lunch last time in summer 2013, so was very excited to return for dinner).First of all the service is spectacular. Someone reached out to me about a week before asking if there was anything special the restaurant could do because we were celebrating a birthday. That same person greeted us at the door when we walked in and remembered it was my boyfriend&#39;s birthday.Everyone else was also so attentive, and the attention to detail was incredible. The atmosphere, though elegant was not pretentious and many people (ourself included) were often see chatting away with the staff and laughing with them. Lucy Liu was also dining 2 tables down from us!We had about 4-5 glasses of wine each to pair with our food (we didn&#39;t want to do a full tasting, 8 glasses of wine is just too many), and the sommelier was wonderful and picked great pairings based on our descriptions of what kind of wine we like.On to food:They adapted everything for my boyfriend to be gluten free, from the tarts to the breads to the crumbles, it was very impressive that they were able to make all of his items gluten free.The first thing they bring is the black and white cookie in a box, which was a savory cookie with apple and cheddar; it&#39;s very cheesy and delicious.They then bring an assortment of small bites: parsnip pie, celery root with black truffle, rutabaga with celery and walnuts and salsify with garlic and thyme. My favorite was the celery root and parsnip pie.Then main dishes were the following:Caviar Benedict with smoked sturgeon, diced ham and picked egg yolk. I love caviar (who doesn&#39;t) but don&#39;t love ham flavor and still found it to be awesome.Foie Gras marinated with black truffle and mushroom - holy moly this was delicious. The bread they served with it was croissant like and was perfect. There&#39;s also an option for seared foie gras, but I prefer chilled, maybe will try seated next time if they still have it.Lobster, which was smoked and steamed at the table and then taken back to be plated, with fennel, clam and bouillabaisse. I don&#39;t like licorice flavor, but the fennel was not overpowering.For the vegetable course I chose the Butternut squash, which was roasted with bone marrow and pumpkin seeds and my boyfriend got sweet potato wrapped in bacon with maple syrup glaze. Both were very delicious.For the main dish, there was a choice between duck and oxtail. I chose the duck, which was glazed with honey and lavender with plum and onion. The skin was perfectly crispy and there were subtle Indian flavors on the skin from cumin. I would&#39;ve preferred a sweeter glaze, but the duck was still delicious and cooked perfectly. My boyfriend enjoyed his oxtail but I thought the duck was better.They give you 2 side dishes with the main course: Brussel sprouts roasted with bone marrow and pumpkin seeds, which were amazing and parsnip pure with variations of juniper, also very good.After the main course was a cheese course with bitter greens, which for me was basically a deep fried cheeseball and was delicious. My boyfriend&#39;s version wasn&#39;t deep fried.For dessert we chose the baked Alaska, which was huge and prepared table side. Though tasty it was a bit too sweet and alcohol flavored for me to finish.There&#39;s also the fun game where you match the chocolate bars with the type of milk (cow, buffalo, sheep and goat), I got the sheep and goat right, but switched the cow and buffalo.The chocolate covered pretzel with sea salt was delicious and gluten free!Overall I&#39;m glad I finally returned for dinner.

Also, the gastronomy-inspired Winter in Provence--was plain strange tasting.I will give them credit for their phenomenal service and accommodations, however. One of my dinner companions had a laundry list of allergies. The waiter patiently listened to each and every one, and assured that he too had a wonderful meal that thankfully did not trigger his untimely death. At the end of the meal, they provided parting gifts--a custom print of the menu we had, and a canister of house made granola. (The granola--I learned later, was better than my actual meal).

Boom! Welcome to Eleven Madison Park. Dinner&#39;s only just begun. It took us a while to get through them all, mixing and matching as we went along. I love a place that encourages one to play with food.This year, the Foie Gras, Honey Nut Squash (sage + cinnamon), Lobster (butter poached with rutabaga and pear), and Duck (honey and lavender glazed with turnip and huckleberry) impressed me the most. I happily sat there relishing each second that went by. I never wanted the three-hour-plus dinner to end. I can appreciate (and admire) all it took to birth them all.Served with mixed greens that actually worked very well and in a rare EMP moment, the photogenic &#34;Cheese Course&#34; (really a cheddar tart seamlessly disguised inside of an apple), wowed with its presentation, but disappointed us with its overpowering one-dimensional cheddar taste. Additionally, despite its showy flambing right on the table, I couldn&#39;t enjoy the Baked Alaska. The rum drowned the vanilla and meringue&#39;s sweet and delicate taste, instead of enhancing it. Thankfully, the chocolate &#34;Name the Milk&#34; game ended dinner on a high note. For the record, I failed the test miserably. Pfft. Must. Play. Again. Complimentary St. George Apple Brandy was offered towards the end, but at 40% proof, I couldn&#39;t take more than a couple of sips. Ouch! Kudos to the women next to us who gulped much of it down. Impressive!Once again, I witnessed one of the white cloud-like tablecloths ironed and perfected on the spot. No creases accepted here. That attention to detail is what I know the staff strives for with every table serviced. It&#39;s important to note these highly awarded restaurants keep raising the bar themselves, time after time. I&#39;ve now come to expect the perfection with each visit; it&#39;s part of the marvel and draw.Once finished, we received jars of the famous EMP granola as a keepsake, along with a very carefully designed and curated copy of the night&#39;s menu.Full payment is required in advance. The set price excludes corkage fees, beverages, and tax. Like many NYC restaurants now, gratuities are not accepted.

I brought my fianc here for his 30th birthday because all this guy wants is a good meal, and a good meal he received. I would say there were about 12 &#34;courses&#34;- from mushroom appetizers, mini English muffins with eggs Benedict caviar, lobster, venison steak, potatoes with hazelnut spread, chocolate covered pretzels- all served as one surprise after another. They also had a guess that (chocolate) milk game post-dinner and a Baked Alaska cooked right in front of you at the end. Not to mention they gave us a bottle of Brandy and basically said the table is yours for the night; I like that they don&#39;t rush you out.In my opinion this is definitely a special occasion kind of dinner experience. Not only for the price (about 300$ per person), but also that it isn&#39;t your ordinary 3-course dining experience. The maitre de emailed me to ask what he could do to make the experience extra special- I recommend getting a kitchen tour because my fianc LOVED this surprise! The maitre de said he would leave a note for my fianc if I told him what to write, but for some reason the note was MIA which was a bit disappointing.

Maybe, 95%.Now of course, on a five-star scale, EMP can&#39;t earn anything less than five stars. C&#39;mon, now, it&#39;s #3 on the World&#39;s 50 Best list (EDIT: Yeah, it&#39;s #1 now). But maybe my observations can help future potential diners, before they plunk down more than a half-grand (for two) on dinner ...First of all, I got our rezzies (6:30p for two on a Saturday in late March), by literally waiting at the computer for the 9 am table release, as if I were buying concert tickets. So there&#39;s that.Our experience began before the date, with an e-mail from EMP, looking to confirm, and personalize, our meal. I responded with a paragraph about our backgrounds (he did ask ...) and why we were dining there (10th wedding anniversary). I got a polite reply e-mail.The information I shared was peppered by our waiter into his conversations with us during our meal. It was a cute touch, but felt a little ... artificial?As we approached, the building, and the room, could not have been more stately. I&#39;m a sucker for limestone, and also for art deco design, so I was gaga. I was not gaga for our greeter, who was warm, effusive, and prone to open-armed gestures as if he were going for a hug. Hey, I&#39;m cool with hugs, but not if that&#39;s not your intent ... the service from everyone over the night was similar. They didn&#39;t take themselves too seriously, but there was more than a hint of ... awkwardness? It could very well be that *I* was the awkward, nervous one, and they were trying to deal with me. Entirely possible. Almost ... likely ...As for the rest of the design elements, nothing was left to chance. Even the banquettes had pillows between the diners, as a kind of visual break. Nice touch. Some two-tops were sat across from each other, some, side-by-side. It was clear that that this was for traffic flow, but side-by-side eating can be awkward for some ...The final design element I wanted to mention was the working rotary phone near the bathrooms. It&#39;s old-school and awesome, and I loved it.I got the wine pairing - I appreciated the thought that went into the selections, especially for going local with New York wines (I loved the Empire Estate dry riesling).So, the food. Portion size was an issue on some things, like the lobster, and the flambed Alaska (where the heck did the rest of it go?). But generally, the food was impeccable, and in some cases, transformative. The duck - after the duck at EMP, I don&#39;t remember eating any duck before it, nor do I think I can ever eat duck ever again. It will never even approach what EMP served me. The same for the foie gras, and the parsnips, surprisingly. Those parsnips blew me away.Wife had a similar experience. She loves mushrooms, and they redefined mushrooms for her.The &#34;New York&#34; touches were cute - the &#34;black and white&#34; savory cookie to start, and the &#34;eggs benedict&#34; caviar (though I wanted to taste more of the caviar - if I&#39;m eating caviar, I want to know it).I really appreciated the final course, the &#34;name that milk&#34; game, where different chocolates were made (by Mast) with different animal milks. Though I failed that game, I definitely picked out the funky, grassy, or mild notes in the chocolate. Fun and also educational.The reason I can remember the meal so well is because they print up personalized menus at the end of the meal! God, how long have I wanted this. A record of what I ate! So impressive.As impressive as waiting at the door with your coat without having a coat check ticket. The only way they can pull that off is by paying close attention, which was a recurring theme through the night.Finally, the parting gift - the container of granola! I snacked on it all week, that stuff was crack.Eleven Madison Park gave us the best meal of our lives (sorry, Gramercy Tavern).

It&#39;s from the 90s. All the residents from some town are in this black and white world and everyone thinks that the black and white life is fine and dandy. Then some random guy gets puked on by a rainbow and brings color to the world and the townsfolk realize what they&#39;ve been missing all along. Not familiar? Admittedly, I&#39;ve never seen the movie; so the above plot summary is entirely fabricated. However, my experience at EMP is what I imagine those poor schmucks in Pleasantville experienced when they finally looked up at the world and saw things in vivid vibrant color. I thought I knew what eating good food was like, and then I had EMP.I&#39;m a pretty seasoned eater. I celebrate chefs like normal people celebrate Beyonce. I hope someday to leave a bloated happy corpse full of foie gras and butter. I&#39;ve had Michelin starred restaurants around the world and this place blew them all out of the water.The decor is tasteful and inviting but not pretentious. Fluffy pillows on benches, cozy nooks, beautiful linens, and amazing flower arrangements greet you as you walk in. The lighting is warm and welcoming as the ambiance strikes that perfect balance between casual and upscale.The service is everything you&#39;d expect from the no. 3 restaurant in the world: fast, attentive, gracious, and friendly. Our server was incredibly kind and put up with our selfies, questions, requests for information and clarification, and even shared some personal anecdotes -- which made the setting feel even more relaxed. The sommelier hit it out of the park when my friend asked for a &#34;funky strong fruity wine like they have in South Africa.&#34; A gorgeous Australian(?) chef came out and prepared a dish tableside (I almost tried to marry him as he was plating my lobster). The human element at EMP was a perfectly balanced whirling dervish of style, panache, and hospitality.Now to the food. God the food. Chef Humm really knows how to work his flavors. Less restrained than a more traditional fine dining establishment like Le Bernadin, EMP throws out bold combinations of flavors and textures, beautiful tableside presentations, and a sense of creatively with the dishes that makes you feel like the kitchen would be a really fun place to work.We opened with a gorgeous black and white savory cookie. Hints of apple and cheddar with a rich, flaky, crumbly texture. Delicious and the perfect way to start the meal off.Next, the sexy Australian chef comes out with a multi tiered rack of small appetizers. All vegetable based and presented beautifully; each bite was a celebration of the distinct flavors of its star vegetable.There are several amazing courses which I have to skip over b/c of character limits on these reviews (The sexy chef is nowhere to be found during these courses. I assume it&#39;s because he is planning our courtship). They are all very, very good. Trust me.My favorite dish of the night is EMPs take on Eggs Benedict. Small tins of egg yolk, ham and caviar are served alongside a quartet of adorable tiny biscuits. I could eat a wheelbarrow full of this stuff. The egg yolk and caviar is rich and unctuous with smoky ham flavor; and the biscuits are light and fluffy with just enough crunch on the crust so that you have that element of textural interest in the mouthfeel.Later in the meal, Sexy Chef returns with a large broiler pan filled with lobsters, clams, fennel, seaweed, and FIRE (the showmanship!).  I lose myself in my husband to be&#39;s eyes (and accent) as he pours a flask of fragrant white wine into the pan; and I&#39;m swept away in the aromatics of the fennel and the wine as a cloud of steam wafts up. My future husband then takes the broiler away. We almost have our first fight. He soon brings the lobster back on a plate and we make up. The lobster is served with an amazingly complex and delicate Uni mayonnaise and some kind of sauce made up of lobster juice and magic.One last highlight was from another &#34;choose your own adventure&#34; course. A choice btw a sweet potato with apple or butternut squash and bone marrow. I pick squash and my outraged companion chastises me for being from Texas and rejecting a sweet potato when there&#39;s one offered. I do not regret my choice. The smokey richness and umami of the bone marrow plays perfectly with the sweetness of the squash. Her sweet potato is perfectly cooked with a crispy outer skin and a beautifully pillowy interior. My companion eats large bites of my squash and I try not to stab her hand with my fork.As the evening progresses, there are more courses, amazing tea, decadent cheeses, and a very high stakes chocolate game at the end; all of which must be omitted for brevity&#39;s sake.

The falafels seemed a little greasy than normal, and rather than receiving two of each type, we received only one Kalamata olive one and three Tunisian spice ones. The platter was a generous dollop of hummus with a drizzle of olive oil and tahini. The tabouleh and chopped tomatoes and cucumbers were a nice refreshing contrast to the heavier falafels and hummus. The pita at Taim (we had the whole wheat one) is thicker than most, but it was warm and topped with a delicious blend of spices.

A huge win for @foodanyc!Famously known for their falafel sandwiches. Tam offers up 3 different kinds of falafel; Green, Harissa &amp; Red. Green being your traditional, far from boring, falafel with hints of parsley, cilantro and mint. Harissa, the falafel with a mild kick, created from a unique blend of Tunisian spices. And lastly, red, falafel made from chickpea and roasted red bell peppers.Ironically much of Tam&#39;s secret ingredient profile flavors stem from Chef Einat Admony sticking to staying true to Isarel&#39;s roots. Admony&#39;s refusal to translate traditional ethnic Israeli flavors to the masses has not only worked in her favor, but made Tam almost an overnight success.From their inaugural opening in 2007, Tam - which directly translates to &#34;tasty&#34; in Hebrew, has stayed true to their name. Focusing on the little things, such as frying to order, to ensure an initial crisp exterior with a moist and flavorful inside; to only using the freshest ingredients possible; has kept Tam on top. Its, really no wonder why Tam is on everyone&#39;s must eat list.

If you like eggplant then get it. For the falafel, I like the roasted red pepper falafel the best because it is the least spicy. Both dishes are made fresh and are delicious! They only offer one type of hummus but it&#39;s a goodie. The dishes come with two sides and warm pita. Taim happily substituted eggplant salad for the tabouli salad so definitely feel free to ask!I just love how much food they give you! Its a really filling and hearty meal. The dressings are also very flavorful and add dimension to the dishes.Be aware that this Taim location is really small. It only has bar seating at the window that can only really seat a few people. If you want to eat at the restaurant then definitely go to the Soho location.I&#39;ve also gotten Taim delivered via caviar. I reheated the Falafel and pita but overall it held up well.Tip: if doing delivery, ask for the falafel and hummus to be packaged separately so that the falafel does not get soggy.UPDATE: what did I do to deserve such a change in quality Taim? I feel like you&#39;ve gone ice cold. When I order on delivery, the amount of food I recieve is consistantly getting smaller and smaller every time. The packaging has changed so unlike the past where the packaging had different sections, everything is stuffed in one box and smushed together. The food arrives a mess and really unpleasant. I tried to fix the situation by being direct in my order notes, but the restaurant completely disregards them. Not to mention I prefer to reheat the falafel, but can&#39;t when its covered in hummus. I order the platter and literally get a spoonful of Israeli salad and Tabouli. I even asked the woman over the phone to give me extra pickles and she gave me one. Hate to say I&#39;m no longer a fan.

The cashier was utterly unapologetic when I arrived, and did not offer any sort of complimentary item to make up for my troubles.Perhaps I went into the sandwich with the wrong mindset after that fiasco, but the so-called visiting chef clearly ought to steer clear of the falafel world, as it was one of the more disgusting smatterings of uncomplimentary ingredients that I&#39;ve seen sandwiched between two pieces of (by then) cold and damp pita.

This may have been the most beautiful and colorful dish I have ever been served. Do yourself a favor and order it, it was cooked to the perfect temperature.Contorni:Crispy potatoes served salsa biancoThe potatoes were crispy and delicious.

I&#39;m not sure it deserves its &#39;must order&#39; status - maybe I got a funny batch, but my pasta was oddly inconsistent in texture. Some parts were normal, then mid-chew I&#39;d notice an especially al dente spot that was chunkier than the rest. Even that aside, I thought the flavors were rather one-dimensional as the taste of mushroom was pretty much the only thing discernible - the dish comes topped with fine ricotta shavings (which they call ricotta insalata, which baffles me because what is the similarity to salad?) that are delightful when eaten alone, but too delicate to add much when eaten with the ragu.Overall L&#39;Artusi didn&#39;t strike me as particularly memorable this time around, but that doesn&#39;t mean the food wasn&#39;t good, and I&#39;d certainly come back again to try dinner.", "Ratings": 4.0, "Reviewcount": "199", "coolvote": "", "Usefulvote": "", "Friendcount": "347", "funnyvote": "", "No_of_checkin": "1", "No_of_Photos": "244", "Review_length": 236}, {"Review ": "This place was incredible!

It was a nice surprise to begin our dinner. We ordered the charred octopus and I really enjoyed it. The octopus was huge, tasted fresh and had the perfect consistency. The lemon made for a nice balance to the acidity of the octopus.For our mains, we decided to share three pastas: orecchiette, ravioli and cavatelli. All of their pastas are fantastic standalone. They&#39;re all chewy, doughy and soft. I loved them!! My favorite was the orecchiette which came with sausage, salumi and pecorino. The ravioli was superb but I was pretty disappointed with the cavatelli. While the pasta was delicious, I didn&#39;t think the toppings in the dish went well with the pasta. Everything felt out of place and didn&#39;t really fuse with the cavatelli...no cohesion with the dish.For dessert, you HAVE to leave room for the olive oil cake. It&#39;s amazing!!

We got the starter of cheese ($7 each) with bufala mozzarella and housemade ricotta. There was some reddish chutney (strawberry maybe?) and housemade crackers. The portions of cheese were very tiny, but they were both delicious, as were the crackers and the chutney. We also got the mushrooms with cheese and a fried egg. Again, super tasty, but really small for $17. Roasted mushrooms should maybe have a maximum of $12 at any restaurant. And this isn&#39;t even a Michelin starred restaurant, so I&#39;m not sure how they charge $17 for such a small portion (could be considered a side dish).The spaghetti with garlic and breadcrumbs was excellent. Small portion for $18 but satisfying. Not too overly garlicy and not a ton of breadcrumbs--it was just right. The roasted potatoes as a side dish for $9 with &#34;salsa bianco&#34; were some of the best potatoes I&#39;ve ever had. A++ on the potatoes. I actually was going to give this a 3-star rating, but the potatoes deserve an extra star; hence, the 4-star rating for this place. My friend got the garganelli with mushroom ragu. I thought they were delicious, though it was a little too mushroomy. If you like a subtle mushroom flavor, stay away from this dish.Definitely worth going to if you&#39;re willing to spend more on quality, and not quantity.", "Ratings": 4.0, "Reviewcount": "18", "coolvote": "", "Usefulvote": "", "Friendcount": "0", "funnyvote": "", "No_of_checkin": 0, "No_of_Photos": "56", "Review_length": 338}, {"Review ": "The marscapone cheesecake is consistently amazing.

For a restaurant like this, I thought they would have way better bread. We ordered a meat, two seafood, and two desserts for two people. The portion sizes are smaller, so we were full but not overly stuffed at the end.Seared sweetbreads, white bean puree, escarole, chorizo - I liked the white bean puree and the citrusy sauce. The sweetbread themselves were a little chewy. I think I prefer them fried.Charred octopus, potatoes, chilies, olives, pancetta - The octopus was tender and artfully surrounded by the little fingerling potatoes and olives.Arctic char, caper aioli, fingerling potatoes, chilies, scallion - Flaky fish the same color as salmon, but less fatty. I didn&#39;t like the aioli because I dislike mayo, but the fish was cooked well.Olive oil cake, golden raisin marmellata, vin santo, creme fraiche mousse - This lived up to expectations. The cake was so light and fluffy. The raisins added some sweetness. The creme fraiche had sea salt on top, so the combination of salty and sweet was perfect. I enjoyed this more than the entrees.Hazelnut chocolate torta, praline crunch, salted caramel gelato - I preferred the olive oil cake. There wasn&#39;t too much flavor in this.

Impressive.We started with a fantastic bottle of wine. As well as two cheeses (came alongside these delicate umami buttermilk crackers which were to die for). One was the ezra from murrays cheese shop which was delicious.Next we got the raw scallop crudo style which was one of the most delicate scallop preparations I&#39;ve ever had.

Wasn&#39;t blown away the second time I came here but the pastas are still delicious and I felt like the meal was pretty healthy.

This higher class establishment is in contention for my favorite new restaurant of 2016. The appetizers and pastas were marvelous.Crudo:Beef Carpaccio (5/5) - Rye crisps, subtle horseradish crema = thumbs all the way upVerdura:Roasted Mushrooms (4/5) - I am not a fan of fungus among us. However, the mushrooms were chopped and had a crispy texture that paired perfectly with pancetta and fried egg.Pasta:Spaghetti (5/5) - Who said that spaghetti needs to be paired with red sauce? The best thing on the menu.Orecchiette (4.5/5) - This ear shaped pasta listens to your inner meat cravings and satisfies them.Tagliatelle (4.5/5) - A classic that sets the bar high for all other Bolognese dishes that come after it.Pesce:Branzino (2.5/5) - Just a simple fish, there are plenty in the sea just like it.Carne:Roasted Pork Chop (4/5) - The sweet potato and lime yogurt harmonized well with the large slab of meat.My friends and I tried to snag a last minute reservation a week prior and failed. We decided to try to sit at the bar but was quoted a 2 hour wait at 615pm on Friday. Luckily, some poor soul canceled their reservation and we were seated immediately.

Simply put, L&#39;Artusi is awesome. They have great service, great atmosphere, great food, and great care for what they do.I did not get to sample too much of their menu this trip, but I plan to remedy that in the future. The cheese plate we started with was excellent and maybe the highlight of the meal. For pasta, I got the Cavatelli with Hot Italian Sausage while my buddy got the Linguine Nero with Gulf Shrimp. Both pastas were really good. The cavatelli in mine were cooked perfectly. The only thing about this dish that I was a little let down by was the fact that I could have made the same dish myself. It basically tasted like Sausage and Peppers. Now, Sausage and Peppers is one of my go to Italian dish staples that I make at home, but I guess when I read this dish on the menu it didn&#39;t sound like that was what was going to come out. I did enjoy it, but I would get something else next time.Both the cocktail I had (King&#39;s Lair - Compass Box Great King St Scotch, Laird&#39;s Apple Brandy, Nardini Amaro, Bonal, Nux Alpina) and glass of red wine (can&#39;t remember which one it was) I had were real good.

We sat upstairs. There are 2 levels. They are both noisy but its to be expected with everyone talking. No bother at all. Beautiful dimmed restaurant, elegant and nice atmosphere. I knew what to order based on reading reviews.FoodWe had the dayboat scallops(raw) - wow never had this before and soo very impressed with this dish, nice and tasty, melts in your mouth. We wanted more. Roasted Mushrooms - this was so good as well. I dont eat mushrooms that much but this was recommended and very glad that I listened. Also ordered the spaghetti - so good with garlic butter and some spiciness to it, as well as the Gnocchi which is a pasta and rabbit, DELICIOUS. For our entree we got the Octopus dish - this one was good nothing special though and we ordered the Quail dish - wow blew my mind and taste buds. This dish was amazingly tasty. Loved this one.ServiceThe service was spot on. Our waiter was great. From beginning to end. They would bring out our dishes in order as we finished them and not before. They started with bread, then the apps, then the pasta then at the end the entrees and dessert. Friendly waiters and knowledgeable.WineThe wine was great. My gf had the Riesling and I had red wine. Both very good too! All their wines are Italian.DessertWe tried the olive oil cake which is recommended and it was pretty good as well. They put a candle on it for her bday.

Recommended by my calibash cousin who dined with me. Restaurant was fully booked, but they welcome walk ins for the bar. Grabbed some drinks, waited about 30 minutes, caught up with each other&#39;s lives and we were seated promptly.What we ordered:- Dayboat Scallops Crudo - Delicious! Refreshing and flavorful with a big of tang, I&#39;d definitely order this again- Roasted mushrooms with pancetta and fried egg - Anything with pancetta is good and paired with the roasted mushroom, perfection! Flavor was a bit sour, savory and rich from the egg yolk. Another must try.- Branzino Fillet - Standard fish, cooked well with a crispy skin, nothing too special but wasn&#39;t bad.- Special of the day - Squid ink pasta with octopus - The octopus was very tender and flavorful! Paired with squid ink pasta (tiny rope like pasta) which was pretty good. Not a fan of the pasta type but flavors were decent- Roasted Brussel Sprouts - I simply love roasted brussel sprouts and I&#39;ve noticed I always order this when I eat out....it has become habitual. Some places do not disappoint, including L&#39;Artusi, others I have no comment.- Olive Oil Cake - Their signature dessert, very light, cake was moist and paired with whipped cream.

I really should&#39;ve snagged a reservation here before its popularity skyrocketed into another dimension. I&#39;ve known about the spot for a few years but put it on the back burner because I figured no one really knew about it. Boy, was I wrong. But it turns out that I&#39;m a very lucky girl, because the bf booked a table here for our anniversary this past Friday. I&#39;ve managed to get him into the NYC food scene, and L&#39;Artusi has been on our joint list since his best bro bud mentioned it (bros always need bros to confirm, I guess). So when I thought I&#39;d be calling it a night early on Friday, I was mistaken--we ended up at L&#39;Artusi for a fabulous dinner. I love surprises and I love food, so it&#39;s safe to say that my man knows me well. Our experience here was easily five stars, but it could&#39;ve been ever better. We&#39;ll be back for more. Now, onto the goodies.Came here at 9:15 on Friday. Our time here actually didn&#39;t start out too well--we had to wait about 20-35 minutes for our table and were famished by the time we sat down. I get that L&#39;Artusi is the place to be at these days, but they need to do a better job of managing patron flow in that way. Thankfully, service post-sitting down was great. Our waitress was knowledgable and everything that she recommended, after our input, was spot-on.When it comes to alcohol, L&#39;Artusi is first and foremost a wine palace (there&#39;s a private wine room here!). Their wine selection is as extensive as it gets, all of it being from Italy. The menu layout itself is as good an advertisement as any--pages up pages of wine, organized by region with corresponding photos. Man, I can&#39;t wait to go to Italy. Next anniversary?In any case, the wine here is as good as you&#39;d expect. Our waitress let me sample a few options to help discern what I was in the mood for (as any good wine spot does). Again, she nailed it. I also tried one of the cocktails, the Stowaway (el dorado 5yr rum, pineapple, lemon, agave, cayenne). Seriously good. I&#39;m not sure why you&#39;d come to a place like this if you don&#39;t like wine, but if that profile happens to fit for you, I can happily report that the cocktail program is as good as the rest of what&#39;s offered here. I&#39;m always on the lookout for spicy cocktails made with something other than tequila, and this fit the bill. My bf tried the Southern Belle for his first cocktail (screw gender roles), which I enjoyed but not as much as my pick.For me, the food here is the main attraction. I was before I dined here, and I&#39;ll maintain that now. This place does everything well. Meats, cheeses, veggies, pastas. One of the best Italian meals I&#39;ve had in the city. I was stuffed at the end of our meal (all food below was split between 2) and I have absolutely zero guilt about it. Eats, below:Cheese and crackers: A+Oh my word. This honestly might have been the best thing we ate all night. I&#39;m pissed that I can&#39;t remember what two cheeses we ordered, though not surprised because our waitress picked them for us. We asked for one hard, one soft. They were both magical. I was partial to the hard one, the bf partial to the soft one. Both amazing.Roasted mushrooms w/pancetta, fried egg, chilies, ricotta salata: A+These did not disappoint, and my expectations were high after reading the glowing Yelp reviews. Sticking a fried egg on top of most things is a good idea. Putting it on an assortment of perfectly seasoned roasted mushrooms is a slam dunk, as far as my taste buds are concerned. Two of my very favorite things. Add some salt and some savory with the pancetta and you&#39;ve got yourself a perfect verdura plate.Gnocchi w/ rabbit, tomato, basil, parmesan: A-Shockingly, the least exciting dish of the night. At first I thought it was because gnocchi is my least favorite kind of pasta, but the bf was disappointed too. Not bad, but compared to the rest of our meal, lackluster. Solid dish, seasoned well, but I&#39;d opt for another pasta next time.Quail alla w/ piastra pear, walnut, radicchio, taleggio: ACan&#39;t pass up a good-looking quail dish. Definitely one of the meats I&#39;ve warmed up to in adulthood. Great flavors, rich but not too heavy.Venison/farro/grapes: A+This was the special entree for the night and thank god we jumped at the opportunity to try it. Before Friday, I was under the impression that the bf didn&#39;t eat deer, so I&#39;m grateful that I was wrong. Perfectly cooked meat and impossibly tasty farro. More of a winter dish for sure, but I didn&#39;t mind.L&#39;Artusi is a great option for a special occasion--particularly a romanic one.

The chefs here really know how to take a simple dish and transform it into something extraordinary.For instance, the spaghetti. The chefs don&#39;t hide the spaghetti underneath a tomato-based sauce; rather, three basic ingredients - garlic, chilies, and parmesan - are all it takes to turn a regular plate of pasta into an unbelievable dish. The garlic is sliced, and as a result, plays a larger role in shaping the flavor. There&#39;s a crunchiness provided by the parmesan, its texture a savory match for the smooth, buttery pasta. One bite, and you&#39;ll understand why it&#39;s impossible to share.The cauliflower contorno is full of flavor as well. The restaurant accommodated our request to leave out the bagna cauda (to make it vegetarian), but I don&#39;t think it diminished the taste at all. I&#39;ve eaten several variations of this dish, and it usually contains pine nuts and currants, but L&#39;Artusi&#39;s version replaces the currants with capers. The absence of the currants&#39; subtle sweetness means that the cauliflower derives much of its taste from the capers. Despite this difference, the lightly glazed and well-roasted cauliflower still makes for a delicious side.The carrots with orange, cumin yogurt, and pistachio is an interesting combination, but it works! Pistachios are rich in general, so they&#39;re particularly advantageous for breaking up the consistency of the yogurt. And because the carrots are very tender, the nuts are able to supply a crunch in their place.The restaurant occupies two floors, but there are never enough seats to meet the demand.

I&#39;ve come here more than enough to be considered a regular and each time it has been consistently amazing steak and stellar service.The decor is modern and perfect for a first date or a special occasion. The restaurant interior is light, bright and airy which is the antithesis to the stereotypical steakhouses you expect to see in NYC. A nice perk is that you can dress more casually and not feel out of place even though it&#39;s considered a high end restaurant. You can eat at the bar (which I usually do) but they also have a second floor which is a bit more formal and has tables for larger parties. They can also host events in which case you could book their private room.Now onto the food portion. I&#39;ve had the Greenwich Chopped Salad, the Crisp Organic Caesar and the Lobster Cobb salad. If you love lobster but you cant commit to having it as an entree I would suggest getting this salad as they don&#39;t skimp on the lobster. Their Caesar salad and Greenwich Chopped salad are both great and the portion is enough to split between two people. It always irks me when I order a salad but it only comes with 5 pieces of lettuce but it&#39;s not like that here. I always switch off between the two depending on what I&#39;m feeling that day.You HAVE to get their thick cut bacon. It&#39;s honestly the one thing I always order when I come to this place. Crispy, thick and juicy it&#39;s the perfect appetizer to share with a salad. 10/10 recommend.In terms of steak, I usually get their Bone in Strip but I&#39;ve had their rib eye as well. I personally prefer their Bone in Strip because I really love adding bone marrow on top of my steak. If you&#39;ve never had bone marrow with steak you are seriously missing out on a food experience. I wouldn&#39;t come here so often if I didn&#39;t think this place was one of the top steakhouses in the city. For sides, I&#39;m pretty simple and I stick with their sauted spinach but I&#39;ve also had their brussel spouts with bacon. I would suggest getting the sauted spinach if you order thick cut bacon as an appetizers.If you have a second stomach for dessert, please please get their CARROT CAKE! I&#39;m usually a huge fan of anything chocolate but this blew me away. If you prefer desserts that are less sweet, I would suggest trying their tiramisu which was light and perfect with an espresso. I know steakhouses aren&#39;t well known for their dessert menu but if you have room in your stomach definitely try their carrot cake!As always Benny has been the most gracious host, consistently checking to make sure each customer is taken care of and happy. He always wants to make sure you&#39;re having a wonderful dining experience and it always amazes me how great he is at remembering people who have come here before which is probably why there are so many repeat customers.", "Ratings": 5.0, "Reviewcount": "1", "coolvote": "", "Usefulvote": "", "Friendcount": "0", "funnyvote": "", "No_of_checkin": "5", "No_of_Photos": "8", "Review_length": 533}, {"Review ": "The ambiance in the restaurant was amazing.

Chef Victor Chavez helped open Smith &amp; Wollensky, and is a 30yr veteran chef from there. He tried retirement, but decided that he wanted to be back in the game. As such, he opened Greenwich Steakhouse.Flavor: 8Cajun Rib Eye: 10/10I&#39;m starting with the best steak first. This baby was cooked to a perfect medium rare from end to end with an awesome savory crust on the edges.But the hint of cumin in the Cajun rub really sets this baby off as the best steak in the joint.The spicy oil at the bottom of the place is reminiscent of the delicious sauce you get with the cumin lamb noodles at Xian Famous Foods, which I love.When you come here, this is the steak to get. Chef Victor just absolutely nails it.48oz Porterhouse: 8/10This is nice and thick, and really goes great with the marrow butter sauce addition.There was some grey banding since this is such a thick cut of steak, but nothing was dried out.48oz Tomahawk Rib Eye: 6/10Unfortunately this was a bit overcooked for our liking. Some parts were dry as a result, but the flavor was still nice.Choice of Cuts &amp; Quality Available: 9All the meat here come from Strassburger, a great supplier. Chef Victor dry ages them for three weeks in-house to develop a bit more flavor for his guests. There are several sizes of the four major cuts available.Portion Size &amp; Plating: 9Portions here are pretty big. The plating is on the nicer side with steel pans being used as serving vessels.Price: 10The prices are on par with midtown NYC steakhouses.Bar: 7The bar is a short stretch on the first floor with some seats along the window for people watching.It&#39;s on a nice stretch of Greenwich Ave in the village too, so likely will be a good spot for nightlife.Cocktails are nice, particularly the Great Kills.Specials and Other Meats: 9The waiter read us some specials that were not on the menu. We tried one of them, a shredded Brussels sprout salad. I thought it could use some more dressing, but it was tasty.For alternative meats, they offer a nice variety: veal, chicken and lamb. Perhaps a pork chop would round it out. We tried the lamb and it was incredible. So nicely seasoned and flavorful.Apps, Sides &amp; Desserts: 8This is the best thick cut bacon I&#39;ve ever had. It was about a half inch thick, and each order comes with three massive slabs. We cut them each in half since we had a table of six.The fries are pretty good as well:The marrow is overkill. If you are eating steaks here, each cut will come with some roasted bone marrow, so no need to go for the app. Here are three delicious boats of bone meat though:Creamed spinach was also nice:As well as the hash browns:For dessert, we went with the ice cream tartufo:Creme brulee:And chocolate cake:All were good, but my favorite was the creme brulee.Seafood Selection: 10We tried the seafood tower, which comes with oysters, king crab, shrimp, lobster and lumb crab meat.The shrimp were massive! For entree items, they offer tuna, halibut, lobster, sole and salmon. Branzino was on special as well. That&#39;s a serious variety!Service: 10The staff here is all top notch. The guys are pure gentlemen and it doesn&#39;t surprise me that Chef Victor would staff his joint with such people. The table breads are served from a basket at the outset.Ambiance: 9They&#39;ve done an awesome job with the space here. The main dining room is on the second floor and boasts elegant chairs and a bright space. Very different from other steak joints.The third floor has a huge table for parties, and holds about 8000 bottles of wine in elegant glass-windowed rooms flanking each side.", "Ratings": 5.0, "Reviewcount": "198", "coolvote": "54", "Usefulvote": "64", "Friendcount": "146", "funnyvote": "34", "No_of_checkin": 0, "No_of_Photos": "4028", "Review_length": 640}, {"Review ": "This place is the bomb!

We go to different steakhouses pretty often. After seeing pictures and hearing great things from IG: Johnnyprime I decided to give this place a go, and oh man...this place definitely did not let us down.We started with the bacon. The bacon was thick cut and had a very nice, almost Canadian bacon type of flavor. My piece was a little bit on the fattier side but overall it was very good. Big plus for the bacon not being sweet or &#34;glazed&#34; with anything that makes it sweet.We split a bottle of Saldo 2015 Zinfandel. For about $64. The wine list had many options at different price ranges. We wanted something more fruit forward so this was a suitable choice.We shared the 48oz porterhouse and the Cajun Rjbeye. While the porterhouse was great, the Cajun ribeye was definitely the star of the show. I have been to several steakhouses that fail with their Cajun- it&#39;s either too spicy or too strong of a flavor that takes away from the steak. Here it&#39;s a whole different case. The ribeye is marinated for a week which makes the Cajun seasoning very mild, and yet, it has a very complex flavor without being overwhelming. It&#39;s a standout steak that should be a must here.The service was great all around. Cannot say a single bad thing about our experience.

Make sure ur hungry when you go because I insist that you go with a group and that you share some appetizers including the bacon which is to die for, the crab cake, and the Caesar salad. All of these items are very reasonably priced and well worth the money. Trust me!!!! As for the main course, I had the Ribeye which was the size of my entire plate and it was cooked to perfection. I had originally ordered the Cajun Ribeye because I enjoy Cajun spices and I like a bit of heat but it was wayyyy toooo salty for consumption and our waiter, Benny, insisted on removing it and bringing me something else to make me happy.

So just as I was about to inquire, he winked at me so I knew that my plan was in play. Then 5 minutes later a bunch of waiters came out with the appropriate amount of carrot cake and a candle and they all sang to my sis and served us all birthday cake.

Unbeknownst to me, there are tables on the sidewalk (the location is amazing and the weather was phenomenal), but we could not procure one in time. In the meantime, the host/maitre&#39;d Benny, gave us a seat next to the bar while we waited for an outside table to open up.While we were waiting, he regaled us with his kindness, background on the restaurant, and other great stories. After getting our drinks exactly right (both my parents can have difficult drink orders), he sent out a bevy of items on the house, including oysters and shishito peppers. All of the appetizers, including the shrimp cocktail, were great. He then sent us free champagne for my birthday.As the outside diners took a while, he made sure that we were taken care of at every turn, not hesitating to accommodate any requests. He then took us outside once one of the tables opened up.The services was incredibly prompt and on point, and I got the cajun ribeye (terrific), my dad got the lamb chops (some of the best he&#39;s had he said), and my mom got a filet that she could not stop raving about.

Wouldn&#39;t say that all the pieces are mind blown sushi experience, but it was definitely still ahhh-mazing. For the price you&#39;re paying to what you&#39;re getting, it is very very well worth it.The experience WILL be VERY different if you get the omakaze for the table. Since for the bar, the main chef (sadly we didn&#39;t get to meet chef Nakazawa himself) makes the sushi for everyone, one by one. But for the table, with the same menu and ingredient, everything is made by the other chefs, which tbh didn&#39;t seem like they&#39;d do that good of a job (a little rushed and kinda inexperienced looking). And this is probably why the price is different.Sushi selection wise, my friends and I thought that there were a little too many salmon pieces (or similar) in the set, they definitely could choose a lot of other nice white fish in their place. Also a little confused about why we didn&#39;t get two unis but instead an uni (which was out of this world fantastic) and salmon roe instead. We also chose to pay a little extra for the wagyu bite, but if you really have to choose, definitely go for the uni.Taste and selection is a 4/5 for me, but the amount, taste, and experience you&#39;re getting for this price bumped up the score.I couldn&#39;t get the reservation the midnight it opened up for booking since I was looking for a specific date my friend is visiting the city.

They have two seatings every night and most days of the week, you are served by head chef Daisuke Nakazawa. The wait staff asks you if you have any food allergies after you are seated. Then over the course of 2 hours, each piece of your omakase is placed in front of you dependent of your speed of consumption. It is a lovely and intimate experience with Nakazawa. Each piece of sushi was fresh and distinct in flavors that highlighted the fish. The omakase ended with a piece of the infamous and still to date the best tamago I have ever had and a fruit sorbet. I cannot praise my Daisuke Nakazawa enough for being so skilled in his mastery and being such fun company in an otherwise very upscale environment.The dining room omakase reservations was much easier to obtain and are also a tad bit more affordable than the sushi bar&#39;s was. I went with my boyfriends family to celebrate a birthday. My experience this time was to be honest entirely not what I expected. I came in with high hopes that this would be just as phenomenal as my experience before and it was not the case. It left me super dissatisfied. I am unsure of which sushi chefs or apprentices were making my dinner that night but each piece of fish was overly seasoned. Too salty, too spicy or too sour. The waitstaff also forgot to offer us our handrolls as the 18th piece. We all left super disappointed.All in all, I would definitely come back for the sushi bar omakase with Daisuke Nakazawa.

This is the ultimate treat-yo-self meal for sushi aficionados or the perfect meal for a special occasion.I was fortunate enough to go recently for my birthday (quarter life crisis! yay!), and the entire experience was flawless from the moment we walked in the door. We were whisked away to the back room (reservations for the sushi bar are still hard to get unfortunately), where our server for the evening immediately welcomed us for the special occasion and the sommelier recommended an amazing bottle of ros.We were settled with our drinks while other servers set our table. Fresh pickled ginger and a finger wipe appeared on the side, along with a set of Sushi Nakazawa branded chopsticks. Then the real magic started.Since we were seated in the dining room, our sushi came out in sets of 3-4 pieces at a time. The server presenting each set was incredibly knowledgeable and able to tell us what type of fish it was, where it was caught, and how it was prepared without a moment of hesitation. Each set was also ordered differently on the plate depending on how we were seated at the table, which I thought was a very nice touch.I&#39;m not going to attempt to list everything I ate or the order, as it&#39;s mostly just a blur at this point. First came a trio of salmon, each more fatty and marbled than the last. One of my favorites was a hay-smoked nigiri, which gave the salmon a subtle, almost lox-like taste. Next, a series of white fish, and then a set of deliciously fatty tuna. At some point, gunkan maki with salmon roe and uni showed up, as did crab and raw shrimp. We were also able to choose between two small handrolls.The pace of the meal was perfect and allowed us to savor every last bite. I&#39;ve eaten a lot of sushi in my day, but there were some phenomenal pieces that I have never tasted before, and probably won&#39;t ever taste the likes of again. You can 100% taste the difference in quality with both the freshness of the fish and the preparation of the rice.Before the final course, we were allowed to order any additional pieces or supplements. We went for just two: the wagyu beef and the otoro. The beef, surprisingly, was probably my favorite nigiri of the night. The flavor was simply incredible.We ended with the famous eel and tamago, which were rich and lightly sweet. However, I liked the lychee sorbet even more, which was probably the best sorbet I&#39;ve ever tasted in my life. It had such a crisp and clean lychee taste; I wish I had 3 more scoops. It also didn&#39;t hurt that they subtly included a lit candle in it for my birthday!So. Was this meal worth it? I would say yes. The service was flawless the entire way through. And even though we were seated in the dining room (seated next to a table of investment bankers treating the meal like they were at an all-you-can-eat sushi joint), the atmosphere was really quite lovely.As for the omakase, some of the pieces were some of the best sushi I&#39;ve ever had in my life, while others I probably couldn&#39;t distinguish from another mid-to-high tier sushi restaurant. If you only eat sushi occasionally or don&#39;t have a sophisticated palate, this experience will probably be lost on you. Otherwise, it&#39;s worth it.I can&#39;t imagine I&#39;ll be back here anytime soon (or ever again). But Sushi Nakazawa definitely delivered on a phenomenal birthday, and I&#39;ll remember this meal for a long time to come.", "Ratings": 5.0, "Reviewcount": "281", "coolvote": "3", "Usefulvote": "12", "Friendcount": "288", "funnyvote": "2", "No_of_checkin": "", "No_of_Photos": "680", "Review_length": 620}, {"Review ": "Rating: 4.5As a sushi fanatic, I&#39;ve had Sushi Nakazawa on my list for awhile now. I was finally craving some quality sushi so I made reservations at the sushi bar. I initially made reservations for a Sunday night, but read that Chef Nakazawa is only in on weekdays so I was able to cancel and find reservations for a Monday seating at 7:15. The restaurant does bar seating 3 times a day: 5 (something), 7:15, and 9:30 p.m.The host was very professional and asked us to wait in the lounge where we were given a drink menu. He also checked in my purse -- I would advise to check in any bulky bags so you&#39;re not bothered during your meal. Otherwise, there&#39;s a hook under the bar by your chair. My boyfriend and I were seated on the very left (of 8 seats). The chairs are AMAZINGLY comfortable.We were given a drink menu with wines, sake, and non-alcoholic beverages. We both decided to do the SAKE PAIRING ($45/p) that comes with 6 very generous pours of different sake to compliment certain sushi pieces.Now for the food: I honestly wasn&#39;t completely &#34;blown away&#34; by every piece of the omakase as I thought I&#39;d be. We were served 21 pieces of sushi, and given the option to either get the two uni pieces (Santa Barbara &amp; Japanese) or a piece of wagyu sushi, OR all three for a supplement of $13. You&#39;re also given a menu at the end of the meal to order a la carte. I ordered a piece of IKURA because it wasn&#39;t part of the omakase.My favorite pieces were: soy marinated king salmon, scallop, the three tuna (the fatty tuna omg), the Santa Barbara uni, conger eel, and the egg custard. The egg custard was out-of-the world, and different from the usual tamago that you get at other sushi restaurants. The dinner ends with a cup of Japanese green tea and a delicious serving of lychee ice cream.Chef Nakazawa was so personable and tried to engage and joke with each of the customers. He works in the middle of the sushi bar and walks back and forth to serve each the sushi. It was an incredible experience being able to watch Chef Nakazawa make all of the sushi. There are about 5-6 other chefs working as well, making orders for people in the dining room and the lounge.Overall, I thought the service and dining experience at the bar was absolutely spectacular and a bit better than the food. I&#39;ll definitely be back again sometime!TIPS:-Definitely eat at the sushi bar vs. dining. The omakase is $150 at the sushi bar and $120 in the dining room, but you definitely wants to see the chefs in action-If you make reservations and need to cancel, you must do it at least 48 hours prior to your reservation or you will be charged (you have to give your credit card info on OpenTable). IF YOU NEED TO CANCEL, you have to call the restaurant or e-mail them. Just a heads up, the restaurant doesn&#39;t answer their phone after 6p.m. so do it far in advance!", "Ratings": 4.0, "Reviewcount": "214", "coolvote": "", "Usefulvote": "7", "Friendcount": "127", "funnyvote": "", "No_of_checkin": "1", "No_of_Photos": "200", "Review_length": 523}, {"Review ": "After spending weeks obsessively checking open table for any cancellations, a rare opening at the sushi bar popped up just a few days before our trip to NYC *queue happy dance at work because who cares what you&#39;re doing cuz this deserves a freaking happy dance*This restaurant was highly recommended by a fellow Foodie friend and man did it take me back to my omakase experience in Tokyo.

Of course the tamago from Jiro Dream&#39;s of Sushi was AMAZING - forever ruined ordinary tamago for me.Although the food was amazing, what makes an omakase stand out to me is the entire experience, including the interaction with the chefs. Chef Nakazawa serves all ten of the bar guests, which is amazing to witness, all while cracking jokes at the same time. I ordered an ikura at the end, but my friend did not. Chef Nakazawa ended up making her a mini ikura to go along with mine - such a kind and thoughtful gesture!The menu changes based on seasonality.

I believe it was mid July, so just a couple months ago. We opted for the chef&#39;s counter, which is a must for any omakase experience. We were seated next to the most pretentious, ignorant, and obnoxiously loud man who wasn&#39;t impressing anyone, including his, I would assume, date. And he wouldn&#39;t stop asking one of the attendants of what the fish is.... that left a sour taste in my mouth. Could you please tell such ppl to quiet down so others can enjoy their meals? Everyone was evidently annoyed.Anyway, we knew that Daisuke Nakazawa isn&#39;t in on Saturdays anymore- and while my prior experience made up for it, it&#39;s unfortunate my fianc wasn&#39;t able to have the same, considering how much DN is- he loves engaging with his customers. The chefs we had were boring, to say the least. But whatever, I was there for thesoosh. I loved it. I realized that the whole counter was completely filled with patrons who had no idea that there is a finger wipe to use after you eat a piece of sushi. They watched me as the first one to go and they followed suit. The chopsticks- I use for ginger. The pretentious guy btw, despite suggestions from the attendants to use his fingers, he was adamant about using his chopsticks- and it didn&#39;t appear as though he knew how to use it anyway. What a nightmare that guy was. Anyway, the lack of interaction from anyone other than my fianc was unfamiliar territories for me. The uni was my favorite piece but every simple piece was well worth the price of $150 pp for omakase- y&#39;all know the usual so I won&#39;t preach. But I have taken this off my top 5 list bc I just didn&#39;t enjoy the experience much and it&#39;s lost much of its appeal.We skipped on alcohol and opted for some two separate/individual teas instead.

From start to finish. Let me walk you through it.First things first ~ you need a reservation. You can make one 30-days in advance. You&#39;ll have two choices, bar seating or dining room. Bar seating is extremely limited but it&#39;s worth it since you get to experience some of the magic that&#39;s happening when making the sushi.Second, this is omakase. For the folks who don&#39;t know what that is, it means chef&#39;s choice. So no, if you want to pick your own sushi, this is not for you. Granted they&#39;ll ask you to see if you&#39;re allergic to anything or not, and they&#39;ll adjust the menu based on that.Third, although this restaurant doesn&#39;t have any Michelin stars (yet), it certainly deserves one or two. It&#39;s very fancy with a classy ambience. Don&#39;t embarrass yourself, dress appropriately.Four, because this is omakase, you won&#39;t get any sides (like soy sauce) besides ginger (for the palate cleanser). All the dishes are perfectly seasoned.Now onto the sushi. The omakase changes from time to time, so it may be different from the pictures or the reviews you get on Yelp. But overall the sushi was excellent, the portions and the descriptions are pretty straightforward and damn they&#39;re delicious. The display was elegant, everything was exquisitely prepared. Each plate is like a story. They will tell you what to taste first, and what to taste last. All of the plates come together to tell a cohesive well-crafted novel. Each plate had its own distinct flavors.If you haven&#39;t watched Jiro Dreams of Sushi, I suggest you do that before coming here.

MAYBE someone dropped their reservation..&#34;. So I checked, and there was ONE spot available at the EXACT time I was looking for. I booked it and kept expecting a call to tell me that their system glitched and that I was not eating there. I got a call to confirm my reservation instead and that led me to my best omakase experience ever.The 20 piece omakase was $120 rather than $150, which was a nice surprise. We ended up spending about $150 before tax and tip though because we also got the wagyu and extra Hokkaido uni nigiri ($13/piece).

Each piece of sushi/nigiri made my heart smile and it was not only the great food, but the whole experience and interaction with the chefs was very memorable.I really liked how they organized the order of the courses, and how it was also educational. For example, when they served the three different cuts of tuna (leanest to fattest) and explained the difference and had us eat them in order- it was a great way to compare and feel the difference in the cuts. We were also presented with long spined Santa Barbara uni and short spined Hokkaido uni side by side, and it was quite a treat to taste the subtle difference between the two. We were at times also shown the intact/live seafood before it was served, which helped us learn more about the type of fish and appreciate it more.Other notable nigiri pieces are the king salmon marinated with soy sauce, scallop with yuzu (omg this was one of my favs), and of course, the tamago that Chef Nakazawa perfected over many many years.I also liked how the feel of the restaurant, even at the sushi bar was relaxed, and the chefs all looked like they were having a great time preparing each piece of nigiri.

I love sushi and was looking for a next level experience. I researched many different places but ultimately Sushi Nakazawa won out. I ultimately picked it because it was upscale, classy and with high quality sushi. In addition the price point, while expensive was not that bad considering the former. Plus, it&#39;s kinda famous! Definitely watch the Netflix documentary Jiro Dreams of Sushi before coming, it just made me more excited! Even though we went on a Sunday when Nakazawa wasn&#39;t actually working.We listened to the other reviews that said to definitely eat at the Sushi Bar and you definitely should. It made the whole thing so much more than just going out for dinner. It was an experience! Sushi Nakazawa is situated on a quiet street in NYC. You walk in where you first sit in the lounge area before being seated into the next room at the bar. The dining room is in the back but we couldn&#39;t see it from where we were. Initially being unfamiliar with the setting and etiquette required for this type of dining experience, it felt a little bit intimidating but became more relaxing as time went on and you knew what to expect. Our server Aurora (who was the BEST) also helped immensely with this as she explained details and aspects of the service as the courses went on. She was considerate and attentive; by no means intrusive, but always readily available. I would rate the service way more than 5 stars if I could. The only snag was with the Sommelier who came with our wine. I at least knew as much that they pour a small amount of the wine initially to taste before filling the glass, but I barely had time to do so before he pretentiously mansplained &#34;you&#39;ve got to taste it to see if you like it first&#34;. I was so put back by it that it could have ruined my night by how awful it made me feel. This guy was a snob of the highest order and perfectly fluent in douche-enese and probably wine, but after that I couldn&#39;t care less what he had to say. Lucky for him, everyone else made up for his lacking.On to the sushi! I have to admit that my tastes are fairly simplified and not very diverse as I usually always order salmon nigiri, sashimi and salmon avocado rolls. I was a little nervous on how I would fare with these unique pieces. I am happy to report I only nearly vomited on two of them, much to my boyfriends horror. Really set a new standard as to why he can&#39;t take me to nice places. (For the record it was the sea urchin and eel, and had everything to do with texture for me). It&#39;s honestly hard to choose favorites, they were all out of this world. So fresh you could taste the ocean, and full of different flavors. It was a whole new experience. Then the rice. Omg the rice. It&#39;s like nothing I&#39;ve ever had before. It was definitely an unforgettable experience.Tips and Suggestions1. At some point in time during the meal service the server came around and explained that later on you will have a choice between two pieces of Uni (sea urchin) or one piece of wagyu beef OR get all 3 pieces for an added $13. Unless you are sure you like Uni or desperately want to try it, it&#39;s my recommendation to do the wagyu beef. It was DELICIOUS!2. I learned that reservations here were super hard to get and usually done a month in advance and was crestfallen because I had started planning only a couple weeks in advance. Guess what though, I still snagged a reservation on the day and time I wanted with only 8 days to go. It took only a little bit of work and perseverance. Basically go to the Open Table app for the Sushi bar. Even if they look sold out, random days and times will still pop up as people cancel or whatever. I saw nearly every time slot for a Friday, Saturday or Sunday reservation open up only 3-4 days beforehand. All I did was go into the app several times (or maybe a bit more) a day to check what opened up. There will be a link &#34;Find Future Availability&#34;. If there are literally no days at all that link won&#39;t be there. Voila! After only 4 days of randomly checking the schedule I got my reservation.3. Dress up! This place is fancy.Final impression: Amazing sushi, amazing staff (this excludes you, Sommelier) and fantastic experience. I left practically popping out of my dress I was so stuffed. Watching the Chefs work was amazing and they were very friendly when my boyfriend had questions. I would love to try other places to compare my experience. The only other caveat was that the sushi bar stool was uncomfortable. It didn&#39;t have a place that supported your feet well and being so short, I actually had to take off my heels as my feet were getting so swollen for hanging for 2 hours. If you&#39;re going to be sitting for that long they need a better stool.", "Ratings": 5.0, "Reviewcount": "114", "coolvote": "1", "Usefulvote": "1", "Friendcount": "62", "funnyvote": "1", "No_of_checkin": 0, "No_of_Photos": "106", "Review_length": 896}, {"Review ": "Rates at the top of the omakase experiences in new york for me.

You might as well having committed to the price of the meal already.Chef Nakazawa is extremely detail oriented as he takes note of what hand you are and then placement of sushi is done according to which hand you use your chopsticks or grab from.

I can see why it&#39;s the most expensive beef in the world.The best part of the experience was getting a photo with Chef Nakazawa. I told the waiter that it was my birthday and he was more than happy to pass the word to Chef Nakazawa.

To be fair, if this spot didn&#39;t have such a reputation and my expectations were managed more appropriately, I might have been able to enjoy it more and I wasn&#39;t served by Nakazawa himself so maybe it could have been better?We sat at the bar and had omakase, ordered the wagyu and both types of uni and a bottle wine. Everything was fine- I kept waiting to be blown away and just was not. I&#39;d say from my experiences, it&#39;s most comparable to Sushi Kashiba in Seattle but given the many alternative options in NYC, Nakazawa was overrated and doesn&#39;t have a Michelin for a reason.

Although it didn&#39;t provide the same superb experience as the bar, it was overall worth it.Food: everything was delicious, but I wish there were more pieces that &#34;wow-ed&#34; me. Some notably good pieces: soy marinated king salmon, scallop, Japanese sea bass, and Hokkaido uni. I also opted for the wagyu add-on, and I definitely recommend it. I also enjoyed the lychee ice cream at the end.Service: overall positive. However, a few things that irked me:1) since the omakase didn&#39;t come with a printed menu, I asked toward the end of our meal if we could get a listing of everything we ate. The server was kind enough to oblige to get me a list, but he was a bit snippy - &#34;next time, please tell us at the beginning of the meal.&#34; Sorry! It was somewhat of an afterthought, but that comment made me wish I hadn&#39;t said anything or asked. Then again, I don&#39;t think it was such an unreasonable request, given the type of restaurant that it is. Didn&#39;t really appreciate the tone.2) we asked another server to take a photo of us, and he gave us major attitude. After he snapped the photo, he rolled his eyes and huffed, &#34;alright then,&#34; even after we said thank you. No kindness in his reply.Overall, it was a positive dining experience.

I&#39;m visiting from CA and decided to make a last min reservation after reading and hearing so much about Chef Nakazawa. I originally reserved a 10:15pm dining room reservation 4 days prior to visiting because that was all that was available, but at 3 days out, more spots started opening up because people began cancelling (you have to cancel at least 48 hours prior to your visit to avoid charges). I ended up swapping my original 10:15 reservation to 8pm, which was much more ideal, so if you&#39;re trying to explore different reservation options, keep checking back on their site/opentable up until your 48 hours starts.When I first had my 10:15 reservation, I was told Chef Nakazawa wasn&#39;t going to be there which was a bummer. But I was so excited to see him when we walked in our for 8pm, he was still on schedule! Didn&#39;t get to snap a pic but his face is so happy and friendly - I totally fangirled. LolSushi was absolutely delicious and it was nice to try new types of fish and flavors. They served uni from Maine and let me tell you, I never liked uni up until this night! Towards the end of your meal, they present you with the sushi menu in case you want to add pieces. We ended up choosing the wagyu beef nigiri which I&#39;ll say was the best bite of food I&#39;ve had in my life! Highly recommend!My bf and I don&#39;t drink alcohol, but we ordered the matcha tea to go with our meal which was a great palate cleanser and I&#39;m just always a fan of hot tea with sushi.Only thing that went wrong (but not &#34;deal breaker&#34; wrong) is that the staff accidentally charged us for the wrong tea, which was twice the price of what we actually ordered. Good thing we double checked the bill! You would think a place so detailed and particular would pay close attention to the bill, but I understand stuff like that happens so definitely not worth knocking off a star.Overall, the experience is for sure worth the hype and I 1000% recommend dining here!", "Ratings": 5.0, "Reviewcount": "32", "coolvote": "", "Usefulvote": "1", "Friendcount": "217", "funnyvote": "", "No_of_checkin": 0, "No_of_Photos": 0, "Review_length": 361}, {"Review ": "Sushi Nakazawa has always been on my sushi &#34;must visit&#34; list and it was my most anticipated stop while I was in NYC. Chef Daisuke Nakazawa was one of Jiro Ono&#39;s protgs from the film &#34;Jiro Dreams of Sushi&#34; and he was the guy who made countless tamago. Even though the omakase menu was $150 per person (not including tax and tip + additional beverage cost), the meal was somewhat filling and the entire dining experience was simply impeccable.[Reservation]: On OpenTable, there are two separate reservation pages - Sushi Bar reservations (about 10 seats per time slot) and Dining Room reservations. To maximize your experience, it is crucial to reserve Sushi Bar instead of Dining Room because you will get an opportunity to interact with sushi chefs, which includes Chef Nakazawa himself. Each evening at 12 AM EST / 9 PM PST, OpenTable opens up new reservation date 30 days in advance for both Sushi Bar and Dining Room (I booked flights two months ahead but the restaurant only allows 30 days advanced reservation? Talk about a first world problem). Unfortunately, I had a really difficult time reserving Sushi Bar even though I followed the 30 days advanced reservation rule. Luckily I did find a 5 PM spot while I casually browsed the OpenTable app and I immediately booked the spot without any hesitation. I do highly recommend 5 PM slots because you will be the 1st batch of customers Chef Nakazawa to serve to (plus you would think the earlier you get in = fresher fish). If all else fails and you absolutely have no flexibility, Dining Room is a lot easier to book and there are usually slots available few days in advance (just know that 6 ~ 8 PM time slots are typically taken by that time).[Cancellation Policy]: If you cancel your reservation within 48 hours of your time slot or don&#39;t show up at the dinner, then you will be automatically charged $150 per person.[Dress Code]: For men, ideally you want to wear business casual attire (e.g. sleeved shirts) and you can still get by if you have a nice pair of jeans. Hats, shorts, flip-flops, and sandals are not allowed.[Atmosphere]: For Sushi Bar, you get a very close interaction with Chef Nakazawa and his team. During our meal, Chef Nakazawa had such a high energy level and he even made some jokes to all customers who sat at the sushi bar. He personally delivered each course and did some small talk during the process. This is an upscale sushi bar, so the staff is always readily available to provide additional explanation for each course. The entire meal lasted about 2 hours.[Winter Omakase Menu]: Chum Salmon (cherry salmon), Sockeye Salmon (smoked sake salmon), King Salmon, Sea Scallop, Bigfin Reef Squid, Japanese Seabass, Golden Eye Snapper, Spanish Mackerel, Horse Mackerel, Golden Striped Yellowtail, Dungeness Crab, Live Tiger Prawn, Skipjack Tuna, Tuna (Lean Bluefin, Soy Marinated Medium Fatty Bluefin, Fatty Bluefin), California (Purple) and Japanese (Shortspine) Sea Urchin, Hand Roll, Sea Eel, Tamago, a cup of green tea, and lychee sorbet.* Highlights: Even though I came here on May, they still serve the Winter Omakase menu. Sea Scallop actually tasted a bit spicy and Japanese Seabass had a hint of kumquat zesty aftertaste. In addition, chef Nakazawa said that the Golden Eye Snapper had high fat content. Almost each nigiri had melt-in-your-mouth texture and I really like the side-by-side comparison between California sea urchin vs Japanese sea urchin (I like Japanese sea urchin a lot better). The meal ended with a cup of hot green tea and delicious lychee sorbet.[Conclusion]: I do think Sushi Nakazawa serves slightly better fish quality and delivers better overall experience than Shiro&#39;s in Seattle and Asanebo in Los Angeles. $150+ can get you a lot of fancy meals in NYC, but there are some experience in life you can&#39;t buy with money. This is the next best thing (other than Shiro&#39;s in Seattle) without having to fly all the way to Japan for sushi restaurants related to the film &#34;Jiro Dreams of Sushi&#34;.", "Ratings": 5.0, "Reviewcount": "1203", "coolvote": "3", "Usefulvote": "12", "Friendcount": "20", "funnyvote": "", "No_of_checkin": "", "No_of_Photos": "8063", "Review_length": 680}, {"Review ": "It&#39;s been a while since my first visit a couple years ago.

Neither Nakazawa or the owner was in the restaurant.TL;DR:Over hyped and over rated. It is worth going if you want to try to famous tamago sushi. There are better options for sushi at this price point in NYC.Full story:I came dying to love this place, but it was a big disappointment.When you come here you&#39;ll realize it&#39;s not like your classic sushi restaurant. It is really dressed up and fancy. They have a loose dress code.There is a premium to sit at the bar but I don&#39;t understand why so I don&#39;t think it&#39;s worth the price. You sit there with 10 others and it&#39;s like an assembly line serving. The chefs don&#39;t really interact with you, tell you the story behind the fish, where it&#39;s from, how it&#39;s prepare, etc... They drop it on your plate and you eat it.The &#34;no doubter&#34; courses, i.e. uni, tuna, are always going to be good even though there was obvious flaws in the preparation and presentation. However, the other pieces were really underwhelming and boring. Since Nakazawa wasn&#39;t in the kitchen, there is a side of me that feels that this underwhelming meal was part of the inexperience of his apprentices. In general, there was a lack of craftsmanship in the execution, notably, the rice kept falling apart and some pieces were under seasoned. The pace to the meal was a bit rushed for me also.Nakazawa emphasizes that the style for this sushi isn&#39;t edomae, but &#34;New York-Mae&#34;, roughly translating to &#34;New York style&#34;. When I think of New York, what comes to mind is bold, creative, daring, in your face type of flavours. My experience on this night was: boring. The best course was tamago (egg), hands down.The final attribution to my review rating is my experience with their reservation system. I booked online approximately 3 weeks in advance, which was initially for a dining room booking since all the bar reservations were booked up. The Wednesday prior to my reservation someone called me at around 11:45am to confirm my booking. I confirmed but also mentioned to the person on the phone that I would really love to sit at the bar and if any cancelations come up I&#39;d love to take it or be put on the waiting list. The response given was that they only accept reservations online. Ok, fair enough. Out of curiosity, I decided to go online to see if there happened to be a bar reservation that opened up, and there was! So I grabbed it before canceling my dining room reservation. I called them back minutes later to cancel my dining room reservation but I didn&#39;t get an answer. I went on their website to see how to cancel and I got two means of contact: their phone number which they only answer after 12pm, and their email. Since I tried their phone number already I sent them an email explaining the situation in detail so there isn&#39;t any mix up. I told them I&#39;ll continue to try calling just in case they notice some inconsistency by the time they read this email and the reservation has been canceled already. I then thought to look at the reservation confirmation email to see if there was an instructions there on how to cancel and there was a link to cancel directly. I used that method and emailed them back to let them know. About 2 hours later, I get an email saying how my bar reservation got cancelled. I called them immediately to get this rectified. Lucky for me, I got to speak to someone on the phone so I tried to give them the condensed version of the story. I got the sense the person wasn&#39;t fully paying attention and/or clearly confused because she kept saying how they got my email instructing them to cancel the reservation. So I decided to tell them the more verbose version, which she then rudely interrupted me with &#34;ok ok ok what do you want?&#34;, clearly no patience for the long story. At the end, my reservation got rectified but this reservation system they have is just bad.

Our primary was Treva, who was awesome - she was humorous and very fun and good with the recommendations. Sushi was excellent, the portions and the descriptions straightforward and delicious. There was a wide variety of fish and seafood, and display was elegant (3 pieces or 4 on a plate, each themed), and allergies were duly noted and taken care of. They took care to serve everyone at the table at the same time.And they were pretty on-point with the sake pairings.They bore with us on the photos and talking across tables, though when we did get a bit loud, they shushed us a bit.Overall, one of the better experiences, and while I&#39;m not a fan of green sea urchin, purple sea urchin was great, and the egg custard (tamago) sushi was phenomenal.

It was my welcome to the city, after a day spent in transit, a 9:30 omakase dinner that seemed almost worth the trip all on its own. My mom was buying, but I&#39;d actually come back here on my own dime. It was definitely expensive, but you can do much worse with high-end sushi, and I thought the quality was top tier.The space was attractive, more slick modern New York restaurant than minimalist sushi bar. Maybe it was the enormous staff, all dressed in suits, but it seemed kind of like a fancy restaurant designed for business dinners. There was a dining room, which I didn&#39;t see, in addition to the sushi bar, where we sat in front of a row of Asian men busily going about their work.There was a lot of bustle behind that sushi bar. The restaurant was really busy, and there were a lot of orders coming in from that dining room. I overheard these poor people figuring out how to accommodate a guest who demanded &#34;no skin&#34; on her sushi. I saw one of the suited servers roll his eyes at one point, and had fun imagining a war of workplace passive aggression between the suited white dudes and the Asian sushi chefs. I guess this is probably why the price point is lower than at like a quiet sushi bar where it&#39;s just one ancient sushi master and ten diners huddled around a counter. A nothing of a trade-off, especially since service here is fantastic. Our server Aurora was friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive. We did the $45 sake pairing, which was totally worthwhile, with six pours of sake that broke the meal up into informal courses. Aurora let us know what all we were drinking while the sushi chefs made sure we knew what we were eating. Also, one of the chefs recognized my mom from when she visited with my dad last year. To our utter delight and confusion, we discovered that she&#39;d been nicknamed Miss California.The sushi was extraordinary, each piece fresh and perfectly prepared--just the right amount of sushi rice, and no extra soy sauce needed. Dinner kicked off with three pieces of salmon nigiri, accompanied by Jokigen sake, a junmai ginjo (FYI I don&#39;t know shit about sake). First chum salmon, then Alaskan hay-smoked sockeye salmon, then soy-marinated king salmon. The chum and the king salmon were remarkably buttery, and I loved the smokiness of the sockeye--didn&#39;t know smoked salmon could make such great sushi.Next we had a delicate piece of hotate, scallop nigiri enhanced with a bit of yuzu. Then aori ika, or big fin reef squid, just chewy enough, served with shiso and a dab of miso. Makogarei and akamutsu rounded out this set, the marble flounder and rosy sea bass both on point. We had another glass of junmai ginjo with this group, the Yuki No Bosha.Aurora then poured us Tedorigawa sake, a yamahai junmai that she said would go well with the stronger flavors of the next five pieces. I love a fishy fish when the fishiness is supposed to be there, and both the sawara, or Spanish mackerel, and the kohada, or gizzard shad, were superb. These were followed by the hiramasa, a robust piece of golden striped yellowtail. Sweet hunks of Dungeness crab came topped with a kanimiso sauce, made from the crab&#39;s funky innards, then a plump, slippery spot prawn brightened with finger lime.A quad of tuna made for a great tasting, served with some Dassai 50 junmai daiginjo sake. It led off with the lean katsuo, or skipjack tuna, otherwise known as bonito (I admit I had no idea this was a tuna until this meal). Akami came next, the soy-marinated bluefin supple and full of flavor. Then there was chuutoro, medium fatty tuna that melted in my mouth, and ootoro, fatty tuna, which melted even faster.We had a choice between two pieces of uni or one piece of wagyu beef nigiri for this part of our dinner, and we opted to get both for an extra $13 each. (The only other supplement offered was the caviar sushi, at $50 apiece.) Both the California and Hokkaido uni were spectacular, creamy and briny, the California uni in perfectly soft little tongues, the reddish Hokkaido uni halfway to liquid, practically quivering on its perch of sushi rice banded with nori. The wagyu beef was just decadent, like beef toro, beautifully marbled. We washed all this down with some Murai Family nigori genshu sake.We got one more taste of toro in the form of a hand roll, in a tube of crisp nori. After that, we wound down with a smokey, delicately meaty piece of anago, or conger eel, dabbed with sweet sauce. For dessert, first a tamago nigiri, the egg sweet and fluffy, then a small scoop of lychee sorbet with a spot of houjicha, a light, cleansing note to end on. Somewhere in there, we finished our sake pairing with Kenbishi sake, a yamahai junmai koshu.This was a tremendous meal, one that I hope to repeat. I spend maybe one precious week in New York every year, but odds are good I&#39;ll come back to Nakazawa at some point, with or without Miss California.", "Ratings": 5.0, "Reviewcount": "3070", "coolvote": "9", "Usefulvote": "11", "Friendcount": "3588", "funnyvote": "7", "No_of_checkin": "", "No_of_Photos": "93", "Review_length": 890}, {"Review ": "I&#39;ve been dying to try this place and was lucky enough to get reservations at the bar. it wasn&#39;t very hard to get reservations - you can book up to a month in advance and I just refreshed opentable at 12am.my friend bailed on me, but luckily my boss said she&#39;d go with me. we tight like that. we got there a bit late and the others at the counter had already started their first piece. i didnt realize that everyone at the counter gets served at the same time. the first pieces that came out were salmon and each piece after that was better than the last. we also got the sake pairing, which will get you pretty drunk by the end. i opted out of the uni (it&#39;s not an acquired taste, people), so they replaced it with toro.my favorite were: fatty toro and the tamago. the tamago was like eating a pound cake. i still don&#39;t understand, but it was the best thing i&#39;ve eaten in a long time.", "Ratings": 5.0, "Reviewcount": "304", "coolvote": "2", "Usefulvote": "3", "Friendcount": "174", "funnyvote": "5", "No_of_checkin": "1", "No_of_Photos": "1023", "Review_length": 172}, {"Review ": "I&#39;ve waited a long time to get the chance to eat here. Honestly, it&#39;s not as expensive as the 4 $ signs suggest. First things first, how do you book? I chose to use Opentable to make my reservation. You can make a reservations up to 1 month before. You have two options: Bar seating or dining room. I was up right at midnight to make my booking and I wasn&#39;t able to make a reservation at the bar. Although I was a little disappointed I managed to get a table in the dining room without any issues and I REALLY enjoyed my experience.Located in the &#34;gay&#34; neighborhood just a couple blocks down from the Stonewall Inn, Sushi Nakazawa is an innocuous modern restaurant situated what looks like a residential area. Once you get inside, you&#39;ll be quickly greeted by friendly staff who will take you to your seat. It is unlikely for you to get a seat just by walking in. Everyone there gets the Omakaze with plate after plate of sushi rolls. In one omakaze you get 20 rolls for $120 per person (not nearly as expensive as I thought...) Everything is seasoned perfectly. You don&#39;t get any other sides to dip your sushi in because everything is seasoned perfectly as it should be.The sushi is local and fresh. I think what stunned me the most was the first dish of 3 types of salmon. One was a white salmon that was ... white but tasted exactly like the salmon you would expect. What a great way to start your dinner! I was full at the end but for those with bigger appetites, you can order individual rolls at the end.I think that eating at the bar is a little overrated AND I think it&#39;s more expensive. Remember you should probably dress nicely to go here. A tie is unnecessary but shorts, jeans or jorts are just not acceptable.

A lot of good sushi has to do with equal parts craft and equal parts sourcing and you get it all here at Nakazawa.My husband made a reservation for us to eat the omakase at the sushi bar for my birthday - reservations open up 30 days in advance online. You need to reserve right at midnight because it fills up in minutes. There are 3 seating a night- we went to the 930 (think the others are 530 and 730) You also better show up (why wouldn&#39;t you - or not be late ) as they will charge you $150 if you don&#39;t.Service is really as you&#39;d expect - serene and calm. It was fun watching the chefs work at the bar but it was probably the calmest sushi bar I&#39;d ever seen. Wasn&#39;t too much of a show per se. You can I think more easily eat in their lounge but all sushi comes from the bar.Decor is zen and monochrome - simple and clean as the Japanese would have it.Drinks - they have an extensive list of sake, wine (more by the bottle versus glass), beers ( my husband ordered a Japanese red rice ale which was malty and flavorful- very interesting) and I glasses of Sauv Blanc and Gruner.As for dings on service, sometimes it was hard to hear or understand the chefs so I wish that our server did a better job of explaining each course. I guess she was more conversational when it was required - explaining different cuts of fish and demonstrating what was unique about each piece.For instance call me stupid but ginger was given to us on the side and i had to ask what to do with it - it was a palate cleanser in between each meal which honestly should be explained upfront since some people might think it goes with the fish (don&#39;t do that). You also shouldn&#39;t expect wasabi- that will accompany the piece if the chef feels it goes.They did explain though that you can eat either with your hands or chopsticks. If hands, they give you a little wet napkin to wipe in between.The omakase is 20 pieces and I&#39;m not going to dive into each one because my guess is things change based on what can be flown in. They also ask you what you like and don&#39;t like i.e. My husband doesn&#39;t like roe. Of course customer service reigns supreme here as we noticed the couple next to us didn&#39;t like several of things (sadly) and were quickly given replacements.But, overall the real esoteric Japanese fish were white in nature and ranged from things like Spanish mackerel (can be oily and fishy), to other types of fish which I can&#39;t recall since all of the names are in Japanese.Of course there were crowd pleasers like delicious salmon types - one my favorites was one smoked with hay which has an earthy flavor. Others were more subtle. Others were salty based on the type of salmon like an Alaskan sockeye - you get to try all kinds of fish they create sushi from, it&#39;s not just from Japan.We also got to try very interesting shellfish sushi - like a citrus squid with yuzu and sea scallop - never really had these raw before. I also enjoyed the square type sushi which we had with crab. Mostly all other types were nigiri - no rawOne of my favorites was the 3 piece Tuna trio from most lean to less lean to fatty tuna (everyone&#39;s favorite). You get actually pretty educated about different cuts of fish with this meal!For an upsell you can pay $13 for 3 pieces more which I recommend - two types of uni - one from California and one from Japan. Not sure if I actually like uni unless mixed in a pasta but it was incrediblyFresh.Perhaps the real killer piece of this upsell is the waygu beef. It was grade a something - but trust me it&#39;s worth the upsell for this!! Barely cooked and rare done, I don&#39;t usually eat beef this raw but it was so clean and fresh and flavorful and perfect pairing with the rice (which mind you was incredible- vinegary and flavorful). Absolutely yum with a hint of soy.They also had a tasty hand roll with tuna towards the end of the meal which was salty, and had good crunch from the Nori.For dessert, you end the meal with a delicious house made tea which was so warming. I forget the flavor but it was very good. And then an egg sushi- forget the name but the steamed egg is also pretty to look at and sweet and light in taste. And best yet, a scoop of lychee sorbet. Yum!A really awesome experience on all fronts so definitely go for a special occasion.

MAKE SURE YOU GET ONLINE AT 12:00AM (midnight) 30 days in advance if you want sushi bar experience.Sushi bar or dining room table? I HIGHLY suggest sushi bar experience. Chef Nakazawa interacts directly with those at the sushi bar telling us history behind the different types of sushi and we can take pictures of the entire experience. Also - you can watch all the sous chefs prepping and how they work in tandem. At an extra 30 dollars - it&#39;s worth it especially for those who like to take pictures!Designated Times for Sushi Bar - 5pm and 9:30pm. whichever one you decide, make sure to get there 5-10 minutes early as you want to get the center seat right in front of chef nakazawa.Get used to eating with your hand - if you didn&#39;t know already - each item is offered one at a time with the correct amount of wasabi in it already and you pick it up with your fingers. i repeat - eat with your fingers. The chopsticks are offered to pick up a slice of ginger to cleanse the palate and prep yourself for the next piece. Don&#39;t worry for germ lovers - a finger napkin is provided to wipe your fingers after each sushi piece.Sushi Bar ExperienceWhen you walk in - you find the place stunning and it lives up to it&#39;s 4 money signs. The place is immaculate. All staff is super cordial. They slide all chairs in/out for you. All staff are wearing business professional (aka suits) and well groomed. The staff is just on point with everything in terms of refilling waters, coming by and asking if we need anything else.The omakase is a 21 piece SUSHI (sorry - need to eat rice for those non-carb eaters).

He does a good job walking back and forth so everyone can have a fair shot and see what he is pointing at.The sushi is just immaculate. The fish is indescribable. 60% of the fish is from Japan and are changed seasonally based on Japan&#39;s weather and depending on what&#39;s fresh out there. The other 40% is domestic.I don&#39;t know how much I can rave if you have read this far but the craftsmanship by Chef Nakazawa and his staff are absolute artist when it comes to the sushi. Each piece is amazingly laid out.My favorite piece was teh egg custard sushi. This is probably what he is known best for. For those who watched Jiro Dreams of SUshi - Chef Nakazawa was the guy who practiced for 6 years on how to make the egg custard sushi every day. I can absolutely say he perfected it.Price150 dollars/per person for sushi bar experience and 120 for dining room experience.Sake pairing an additional 45 dollars.For those who want the full experience - expect to drop AT LEAST 600 for two people including tip/tax/alcohol.", "Ratings": 5.0, "Reviewcount": "142", "coolvote": "18", "Usefulvote": "39", "Friendcount": "212", "funnyvote": "11", "No_of_checkin": "", "No_of_Photos": "294", "Review_length": 551}, {"Review ": "Back in NY and was looking for something different.

I sound so shallow here, but you&#39;ll concur with my review once you&#39;ve seen them/her for yourself.The first dish that caught my eye was the &#34;Chettinad Octopus&#34;. I was worried I would be spending $21 on an appetizer only to find a bite-sized dish, but I soon realized I was being cynical. The size is perfect, presentation - extraordinaire and taste - one of a kind. Where else can you find a coconut turmeric mousse with grilled octopus pieces served in a coconut shell on a salt bed? &#34;The salt is only for display&#34;, Ms. Grande informs us.Next came the &#34;Tulsi Chicken&#34;. $15 a plate is a decent price for an appetizer at a high-end restaurant. But for the tapestry of flavors that this dish embodied, it&#39;s a great price.Last, but not the least was the &#34;Calcutta Fish &amp; Rice&#34;. I have never had an Indian fish curry that tasted like this. The base of the dish, the &#34;kasundi&#34; is an ethereal meld of many ingredients -tomatoes, chilies, vinegar, ginger, garlic, oil, tumeric, cumin, palm. Pair this up with basmati rice and the delectable &#34;seasonal saag&#34;. This was hands down, the best dish we tried today.The check said we could use zapper app to pay and get $7 off.

The restaurant is located in the west village, right next to one of my goto places in nyc (the meatball shop). Inside, you notice he simple table and chairs, and the great artwork on the walls. So many little touches make the place feel warm and comfortable.The bartenders were great... sat there for a little bit, and they were very entertaining. Ordered a Devils Acre... which is a bourbon based drink, with honey liquor, ginger and lime. Very nice, and very very strong.For dinner, we ordered the tulsi chicken and the kheema app (which comes with a ravioli with an egg yolk inside of it). The chicken was tender and good... very subtle flavors. The kheema on the other hand was amazing. Even I found it to be a little spicy!For the main course, we ordered the kheema with mash potatoes and cheese... again, really good. We also ordered the lamb chops. They were cooked perfectly, but it was just not my flavor.We also ordered the saag, which was good... and the cream cheese naan. This was unexpexted, with flavors of Achaar and a kick to boot. Again, very good.The food was great... but the service was amazing.

The food was actually all pretty tasty, but there were enough question marks around service/choice of presentation that made it a less enjoyable experience (and I rarely talk about service and prefer to focus on food). I should note that we were a party of 4, which I imagine should be a pretty popular party size, yet many of the items only had 3 pieces, which led to awkward sharing; it would&#39;ve been nice for the server to let us know ahead of time or give us the option to add another piece.Madrasi Egg Roast -- Very cute and pretty dish. While delicious and differentiated, this was one of the items that only came in 3, and it was hard to share since the egg was very small...and they only brought out 3 small spoons.Chili Cheese Toast -- I quite liked the crispy milk bread and creamy cheese on top.Eggplant Bharta -- This was also delicious. The eggplant came in a large jar, but for some reason, there were only 2 small triangles of naan. We asked for more naan, and no surprise, they charged us for that (but didn&#39;t mention anything at the time we ordered).Inked Crab -- Doesn&#39;t look pretty, but the soft shell crab was delicious. Too bad there were only 3 small pieces for the 4 of us to share.Charcoal Smoked Salmon -- The spices and sauce here were pretty good, although the salmon itself was a bit on the overcooked side.Lotus Root Kofta -- This was surprisingly heavy, perhaps because of the paneer, but it was delicious.Cheesecake -- Pretty tasty, but once again, only 3 small pieces.Portion sizes for everything were on the small side, but the dishes were pretty heavy and we filled up on the naan and sauce.", "Ratings": 3.0, "Reviewcount": "247", "coolvote": "", "Usefulvote": "1", "Friendcount": "45", "funnyvote": "", "No_of_checkin": "1", "No_of_Photos": "687", "Review_length": 297}, {"Review ": "This place blew my mind a little bit.

A big hit!For the &#34;jhat se&#34; (appetizers) we ordered the Chettinad octopus and the eggplant bharta. The octopus was cooked to perfection in a bubbly coconut-turmeric mousse and plated inside a broken coconut shell. The eggplant bharta was really special. A hot charcoal is nestled inside of the jar that contains the eggplant. Though it is removed when served, its smoky flavor lingers and infuses an otherwise traditional dish with a bold, memorable twist.As for the &#34;aaram se&#34; (main courses) we ordered the inked crab and the juniper berry lamb chops, with a side of dal rahi.The inked crab was an unexpected delight. The crab is deep fried and somehow completely coated in black octopus ink, which makes it look like it&#39;s burnt to a crisp (it&#39;s not). It&#39;s served atop a bright orange mango curry puree, which makes for a beautiful display. It tastes even better than it looks. Slather the crab in the puree and enjoy.The juniper berry lamb chops were more forgettable. They weren&#39;t bad, but they certainly didn&#39;t stand out amongst all the other dishes we had that night.As a side, the dal rahi was creamy, rich, and extremely satisfying. We regretted not having rice with it.We also had butter/garlic naan and &#34;booti wali&#34; naan. They were crispy and lightweight, similar to Malaysian roti canai. I recommend the herb-rubbed booti wali naan, as it&#39;s a bit more unique.The service was ok, though not perfect. For some reason, we were asked multiple times whether or not we had a reservation. Our waitress was kind and answered all our questions, though everyone seemed quite rushed - enough that it made an impression on me.The ambiance was also so-so. The space is modern and quirky, but not particularly large, so the tables are packed quite closely. On top of that we were seated in a tight corner. We&#39;re pretty small people so it wasn&#39;t a major issue, but it definitely felt cramped.The bill came up to around $120 not including drinks. I think that&#39;s fair for what you get.Overall, I would highly recommend Rahi for an intimate dinner date. I&#39;d definitely come back...

It was so soft and tender it melted in your mouth, but the sauce was a little overwhelming and salty for my taste (flavored were spot on so I still devoured every last bit). Now for our entrees. The waitress recommended the ink crab and the banana leaf chicken which were SUH GOOD. The chicken thigh meat fell off the bone and the sauce was light and flavorful. The soft shell crab was deliciously friend and the mango curry paired perfectly.

He picked Rahi as a unique place that could be a fun departure from the usual. He was right.The staff/management were all very warm and welcoming which was so nice.The restaurant was very clean and had great ambiance. I loved the lighting and decor. It&#39;s nicely done and you feel like it&#39;s a place you want to spend time in.I felt the menu had a nice array of offerings that all sounded good and unique. It was very hard to decide what to get. Our waiter Albert (who was exceptional) made some recommendations and gave us feedback on some of his faves. So we decided to try a couple of dishes that he raved about.For an appetizer we shared the Not-a-Saag-Roti (Albert recommended) and it was delicious. The flavors mixed together so well and it was nothing like I&#39;d ever had before. Both my husband and I were crazy for it.My husband went with another Albert recommendation for his main dish and got the Inked Crab. This dish was out of his comfort zone as he has never tried anything like it. I&#39;ve also never tried anything like that before. It was so insanely excellent words cannot even describe. He also got a side of basmati rice which worked perfectly with his meal.I got the Juniper Berry Lamb Chops which were perfection. It came with a seasonal salad that complimented it perfectly. The flavors of the dish were so on point. They were the best lamb chops I&#39;ve ever had. We shared a Booti Wali Naan bread (of course recommended by Albert) which was also delicious and blended with our meals very well.For dessert I had a type of chocolate mousse and my husband had a yogurt type of cheesecake. Both were wonderful. Sweet but not overly sweet..and unique. Not heavy at all. Really the perfect ending to an exceptional dinner.Rahi is fairly new and is such a find. It&#39;s not your usual Indian cuisine. It&#39;s creative, fresh, unique and incredibly delicious. Our night was more than a meal...it was an experience. And by the way I never write reviews like this....it&#39;s pretty rare that a place has me gushing, but it was that good.Thank you to the staff for such a lovely meal and welcoming.

Every. Single. Dish. blew me and my date away. I got the vegetarian tasting menu and he had the regular tasting menu. The chilli cheese toast is a no-brainer. If you know about and have had amul cheese before, you will know that they have mastered this dish.

The broccolini was one of the best renditions I&#39;ve had and even the more classic items - eggplant, dal, saag, kofta, were all excellent and unique enough. The naans were a bit crispier (and oilier) and less fluffy/yeasty than perhaps many people seek in an indian place; there was a somewhat smaller number of vegetarian/vegan mains than might be expected at an Indian place (but as you can see above, no shortage of options at all) and at times the service, though unfailingly polite and gracious, was uncoordinated.Those minor points aside, this place was a hit.

This place is phenomenal. Walking in, it feels exclusive but in a welcoming way (not at all snobby) and the whole place is so tiny, but its layout is warm and relaxing vs. stressful and too close for comfort.

Superb selection of martinis, cocktails, and wine as well.OK so- the food. I am a diehard carnivore and steakhouse aficionado- I ordered the dry aged bone in ribeye and it was the best steak I&#39;ve ever had. it came with a bearnaise sauce that redefined bearnaise sauce, was perfectly cooked, and had this perfect char that probably ruined me for all future steaks. Two of my friends got the prime rib (which was divine) and of course one of us had to order a burger- best burger I&#39;ve ever had. Best burger any of us had ever had. Like, one of the top 10 things I&#39;ve eaten in my entire life. We also had the mashed potatoes, the creamed spinach, the bacon, and the chocolate cream pie.

Reservations can be a pain as you literally have a plan a month in advance and reservation times are either super early (5 pm, 5:30 pm) or super late (11 pm - 12 am), so plan accordingly. Trust me, it&#39;s SO worth the trouble and totally worth the hype. Not only is the food amazing, but the service and dimly lit atmosphere is top notch as well.I&#39;ve been fortunate enough to have experienced the burger at Au Cheval when I visited Chicago and deemed it the best burger I&#39;ve EVER had. No joke, I have been dreaming about the burger ever since and was sad that the best burger ever was located in Chicago. Then they&#39;ve decided to expand to NYC (KILLER decision), so I definitely had to wait for the perfect moment to have this burger again. I&#39;ll admit I never eat things outside of it&#39;s original location if I&#39;ve had it already as for some reason, it&#39;s never as good as the first time. However, the burger tastes EXACTLY like the burger I had in Chicago. The only difference may be the burger in Chicago didn&#39;t come topped with pickles. The rest was the same - it was juicy and fatty and came on a soft fluffy bun. Definitely go for the full experience and pay extra for the bacon and egg. It&#39;ll cost you an extra $6, but you&#39;re here for the burger, so if you don&#39;t shell out, what are you really there for?! The egg is perfectly fried - love how the waiter cuts through the yolk and drips all the goodness on top of the bacon, so that all of the bacon absorbs it. The bacon itself is thick and salty, but not to salty. You also don&#39;t taste the fat at all, which makes it a little guilt free. Long story short - it&#39;s just a really amazing burger, which actually might be my #1 in NY now.BUT there&#39;s more. Not only is the burger to die for, the French dip (which isn&#39;t featured on the menu - it&#39;s a special that the waiter will tell you about) is not to be overlooked. Not sure if it&#39;s going to remain a regular off the menu item forever, but to play it safe, go now and order it. They take their prime rib and slice it up thinly for their French dip - think of it as your elevated Philly cheesesteak, but with the most tender meat, the most amazing hoagie roll, and a great dipping sauce. Carb overload, but with class as they cut the sandwich into 4 pieces. Honestly, we both loved this sandwich so much, that I don&#39;t know if we enjoyed this more or the burger!And of course you can&#39;t have a burger / sandwich without fries! The fries are your standard fries here - the garlic aioli sauce is what makes it. Ugh, if you&#39;d had the frites at smorgasburg, this is what the sauce was like.Service as mentioned briefly earlier was impeccable. Not only do you feel like you&#39;re dining in a fancy smanchy place, you&#39;re not overwhelmed by the constant check up. We made a note that dinner was a celebration and although we were too full for dessert, they surprised us with 2 large scoops of vanilla and chocolate ice cream accompanied by a gravy bowl of dark chocolate because &#34;you have to celebrate with dessert&#34;.

Dark, romantic, very speakeasy-like setting. The kind of place where you order a scotch (if you&#39;re into that!) We opted for a really delicious Tempranillo blend which paired very well our food we ordered.Our waiter crazily told us that a lot of people start with the burger (as an appetizer!) before their main course, but we couldn&#39;t do it! We did order the American Cheeseburger (add thick cut bacon of course!) and the cacio pepe carbonara pasta (omg best I&#39;ve ever had by a mile!) I know this may not seem like the must order item on the menu, but I highly recommend you splurge and try it sometime. We also had to throw in a side of the golden fries and wow that garlic aioli was killer.The food was absolutely top notch, I&#39;d come back in heartbeat (except I know it&#39;s hard to get a reservation - but I now know why!) Service was very good too. I will definitely be recommending this place to all foodies I know, and really already want to come back. *Note though - tables aren&#39;t for huge parties and it&#39;s probably hard to get a reservation for a party bigger than 4.", "Ratings": 5.0, "Reviewcount": "191", "coolvote": "2", "Usefulvote": "2", "Friendcount": "388", "funnyvote": "1", "No_of_checkin": 0, "No_of_Photos": "418", "Review_length": 247}, {"Review ": "The hogsalt chain has landed in NYC! It&#39;s been a personal goal of mine to try all of Brendan Sodikoff&#39;s restaurants, ever since I took my first bite of the burger at Au Cheval years ago. I&#39;ve pretty much hit up almost of his places in Chicago, so when I discovered that he expanded outside of Chicago and quietly opened up a steakhouse in NYC, I just had to check it out.Reservations: You definitely need to plan ahead if you want a reservation here before 10PM. Reservations are released on Resy 30 days in advance, and I know I wasn&#39;t the only one who planned to pounce on them the minute they were released. I was just sitting there staring at the clock on my phone to strike midnight, and when it did, you could see that prime time slots were snatched up within literally the first minute or two.Ambiance: The atmosphere was typical Sodikoff: very dimly lit, vintage furniture, and extremely small. I&#39;d say there were less than 10 tables in the entire place and probably only 2 or 3 two person tables. We were lucky to snag the only 2 person table that was directly in the center of the room. We felt like VIP since our table was on its own island and we sat in fancy ass chesterfield leather seats.Drinks: The vibe here just seemed like a man&#39;s den. It seemed like a natural fit to be sipping on some scotch while smoking a stogie. You couldn&#39;t come here and not order an Old Fashioned. Their menu had 5 unique varieties of Old Fashioneds and I ordered the Tokyo, which used Hibiki whisky. That drink was pretty much perfect: extremely smooth, slight sweetness, and nice presentation with the giant ice cube.Food: The menu is very similar to the likes of Bavettes, Gilt Bar, and Au Cheval. For anyone who&#39;s visited his places in Chicago, you&#39;ll notice some of the exact same items popping up on this menu. Although not original and inventive, the man knows what the people like and capitalizes on a formula that works.Prime Rib (English Cut) - You can&#39;t go to a place named 4 Charles Prime Rib and not get prime rib. Since we had to catch a show afterward, we settled for the English cut so we don&#39;t immediately slip into a food coma haha. Although prime rib isn&#39;t my favorite cut, they did a great job here. The English cut was 3 thin slices of prime rib served with horseradish cream and a gravy boat full of au jus. The meat was so tender you could cut it with a fork, and the amount of seasoning and fat was just right. I admired the larger cuts that the other tables ordered. The 4 Charles cut just seemed massive...a meat lover&#39;s dream.Cacio pepe Carbonara - Cacio pepe and carbonara are two of the richest and heaviest pastas I&#39;ve ever eaten and 4 charles combined these two and created a beastly, artery clogging gem. There were elements of both pastas. You could really taste the cheesiness of the parmesan and the bold flavor of the pepper of the cacio pepe. Then the typical pancetta and egg yolks in carbonara translated to huge chunks of crisped, thick cut bacon and a fried egg on top. The bacon was just amazing. The fattiness was seared just perfectly to get that thin crispy outside layer and melt in your mouth fatty goodness inside. They were literally bursts of flavor that pleasantly surprised me when I took a bit. It was a little heavy and could quickly consume your appetite, but I&#39;m a fan.Elotes - This seemed a little out of place on a steakhouse menu but I could never pass up elotes when I see them. It was creamy and had a good spicy kick to it. The corn itself disappointed a little bit, like it was from a can instead of from the cob. In isolation, it was a good dish but just didn&#39;t fit with the other things we ordered.Overall, I enjoyed the meal at 4 Charles. While the reservation process was a little stressful, I&#39;m glad I could check off another Sodikoff restaurant from my list. Having dined at his other places, there were no surprises for me...just a good, hearty meat and potatoes meal.", "Ratings": 4.0, "Reviewcount": "168", "coolvote": "2", "Usefulvote": "5", "Friendcount": "160", "funnyvote": "", "No_of_checkin": "", "No_of_Photos": "1469", "Review_length": 723}, {"Review ": "For once, when a friend was coming into town late and wanted to grab a late bite... I had the perfect answer!&#34;Yes, Perfect! I know of a place where I can only seem to get resys at 5:30 or 10:30!&#34;The place is small, and reminiscent of old school steakhouse vibe, albeit more classy and quite romantic even (one table in the middle had leather chairs like a library).Waitress was even more helpful, checking to see if they had run out of a special before recommending it (something so simple, but not enough waitstaff seem to do this).Decent selection of wines by the glass, nothing crazy. My friends&#39; Moscow Mule was perfect (and served in a perfect mug, the way it should be).We got the French Dip Au Jus and the Lobster Roll special for an appetizer (among three of us).My buddy said it was the best Lobster Roll he ever had, I felt the same about the French Dip Au Jus (I normally don&#39;t even like French Dip!!!). The Au Jus had real pieces of beef in it! So amazing.We had of course, come for the famous burger. One with Egg &amp; Bacon, and one with just cheese. The waitress put on a glove, broke the runny yolk, and then cut the sandwich for us, and gave us our shares. But juuuuust before putting it on our plate, she sopped up the runny yolk on the plate with the sandwich. It was delicious.And yes, she was correct, just egg is great, or maybe just bacon... but since the bacon is thick cut and peppery, adding that *and* the egg is a bit gluttonous.Overall, great burger, excellent French dip, great lobster roll... to be really really nitpicking, fries didn&#39;t live up to how good everything else was.The corn side was good, but not very memorable. Neither was the dessert.

The space is dimly lit and slightly hushed, dark wooden panels, very few tables (no wonder it&#39;s so hard to get a res!) and 1 huge grand leather sofa that we were seated on (tip - book a table for 5+ to sit here).Start with the cheeseburger (5/5), the closest to the legendary Au Cheval burger (supposedly, although I&#39;ve never tried it!). Added bacon but no egg figuring that it would take away from the burger itself, and it&#39;s definitely one of the best burgers in NYC. Not too meaty (like Minetta Tavern), no sauce, and perfect just the way it is. Also behold the special white glove the waiter puts on to cut your burger, if you wish. I&#39;m living for this old-school service. We also had a french dip sandwich (5/5), which was just as good as that burger.We decided on the Charles cut prime rib (4.5/5), a good 3-4 oz portion per person for our group of 5, so tender and juicy, just perfect with the au jus and mild horseradish cream. A good selection of sides rounds out the meat-heavy meal. My favorites were the elote corn (5/5) and mushrooms (5/5), but you can&#39;t go wrong with some simple asparagus (4/5) or potatoes either (a warning that the baked potato (3.5/5) is HUGE).By this point we were absolutely stuffed, but could not leave without trying some dessert. The ice cream sundae (3.5/5) is a lot of fun and definitely shareable for 4-6 people. The lemon meringue (4/5) is impressively tall and a perfect tartness after some heavy food.Cocktails are steep but good and strong, I got a Tokyo old fashioned. You should probably try the prime rib, but definitely try some other things to mix it up because pretty much everything else we ordered was fantastic.

He&#39;d been craving for prime rib and I&#39;ve heard really good things about this place.Our reservation was at 5PM. Doors don&#39;t open until then. So we&#39;re waiting outside and when 5PM hits, a gentleman inside comes out and (jokingly) says, &#34;we&#39;ve been waiting for you.&#34; We laugh as we enter a dark basement and we pass velvet curtains as we step further into the room. It&#39;s dark and there&#39;s little lighting and there are some candles making this place dim and intimate. I look around at the limited seating and I start to understand why the reservations for this place go so quickly. We are greeted and seated immediately.We&#39;ve been eyeing the menu all day so we already know what we want (=P). For starters, we got half a dozen of the Fresh Oysters ($3.95 each) and a Thick Cut of Bacon ($12.50). I forget where the oysters were from, I only know it&#39;s from the East Coast. They were some of the freshest I&#39;ve eaten! And the bacon was glazed to perfection - it was like I was eating fatty candy (in a good way)!Then the entrees - a 16 oz Chicago Cut ($65.50) of juicy, medium rare prime rib and an American Cheeseburger ($18). Looking back, we should have added the farm egg (for an extra $2.50) and bacon (for an extra $3.95). We paired these entrees with Golden Fries ($8.50) with garlic aioli. I wanted to try the other sides, but the fries did not disappoint, and neither did everything else leading up to this!For desserts, I was really torn between the Lemon Meringue Pie and the Sundae Royale. The Sundae Royale looked fun and very presentable (the Instagram account in me wanted the sundae), but I opted for the pies. We shared a slice of the tart Lemon Meringue Pie ($18) with a mountain high of toasted meringue and a slice of the Chocolate Cream Pie ($18) with very rich dark chocolate. The desserts were good, but not great in my opinion. I would suggest getting dessert elsewhere unless you really love lemon or chocolate.. or ice cream toppings!I loved it here and so did my boyfriend! I would highly recommend eating here for a special occasion since the prices are pretty high - or I guess it&#39;s average for a fancy restaurant.
